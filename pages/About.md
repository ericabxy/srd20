Why the 3.5 SRD?
----------------

This project uses the 3.5 release of the _System Reference Document_ as a stable framework.

This SRD was chosen deliberately as a well-documented rules system with strengths and weaknesses that are widely understood. It is effectively complete, providing a fixed design space for this project's experiments and demonstrations.
