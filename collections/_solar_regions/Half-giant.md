psionic: 2
title: Eldren
---

--- +2 Strength, −2 Dexterity: Eldren are strong, but not too nimble.

--- Giant: Eldren are not subject to spells or effects that affect humanoids only, such as _charm person_ or _dominate person_.

--- Medium-size: Eldren have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

--- Eldren base land speed is 30 feet.

--- +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks.

--- +2 racial bonus on Craft (any) checks.

--- Powerful Build: Whenever an eldren is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the eldren is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him.

An eldren is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature’s special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. An eldren can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject’s size category.
