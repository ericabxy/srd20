title: Dromite

--- +2 Dexterity, --2 Strength

--- Monstrous Humanoid: Dromites are not subject to spells or effects that affect humanoids only, such as _charm person_ or _dominate person_.

--- Small: As a Small creature, a dromite gains a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks, but it uses smaller weapons than humans use, and its lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.

--- Dromite base land speed is 20 feet.

--- Naturally Magic: Dromite spellcasters gain bonus spells as if the governing ability score were 1 point higher. This benefit does not grant them the ability to cast spells unless they gain that ability through levels in a spellcaster class.

--- Scent: Its antennae give a dromite the scent ability. A dromite can detect opponents by scent within 30 feet. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. When a dromite detects a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed—only its presence somewhere within range. The dromite can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. Whenever the dromite comes within 5 feet of the source, the dromite pinpoints the source’s location.
