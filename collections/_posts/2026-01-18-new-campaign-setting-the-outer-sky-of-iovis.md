_The Outer Sky of Iovis_ is a new, original setting for a science fiction campaign or individual scenarios. It draws from an era of pulp science fiction literature and especially from the planetary romance novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs. "Outer Sky" refers to an orbital region around a fictionalized Jupiter including the moon Ione and other orbital bodies.

The campaign setting is being built from individual artifacts, and this first "playable slice" represents a grounded, inhabitable fragment of the campaign world.

* __One world context:__ [Ione](/iovian_system/the-outer-sky/ione/) is a young, partially terraformed moon beneath the looming presence of Iovis.
* __One surface region:__ [The Ashen Reach](/iovian_system/the-outer-sky/ione/the-ashara-reach/) is a region of Ione large enough to imply diversity and focused enough to be narratively legible.
* __One hub:__ [Kheret's Step](/iovian_system/the-outer-sky/ione/the-ashara-reach/kherets-step/) is a functional crossroads that can act as a destination or an origin point for stories.
* __Two non-player characters:__ [Seret Kael](/iovian_system/the-outer-sky/ione/the-ashara-reach/kherets-step/npc-01-seret-kael) and [Vaelor Teth](/iovian_system/the-outer-sky/ione/the-ashara-reach/kherets-step/npc-02-vaelor-teth) are characters with complex narrative motivations and illustrate of how arcana, technology, and authority interact in this setting.
* Several possible hooks for stories or campaign scenarios are included.

The slice deliberately lacks any visual maps or detailed scenarios. Its meant to provide a tangible surface on which to design scenarios and additional artifacts.
