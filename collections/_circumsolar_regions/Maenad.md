Maenads typically stand more than 6 feet tall and weigh about 200 pounds; males are the same height as and only marginally heavier than maenad females. Maenads have no facial or body hair, and they prefer heavier clothing and armor if possible.

--- Medium-size: No special bonuses or penalties due to size.

--- Base land speed is 30 feet.

--- Naturally Magic: Maenad spellcasters gain bonus spells as if the governing ability score were 2 points higher. This benefit does not grant them the ability to cast spells unless they gain that ability through levels in a spellcaster class.

--- Outburst (Ex): Once per day for up to 4 rounds a maenad can subjugate his mentality. He takes a –2 penalty to Intelligence and Wisdom but gains a +2 bonus to Strength.
