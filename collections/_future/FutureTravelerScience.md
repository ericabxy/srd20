TRAVELER SCIENCE

## REALISTIC SPACE TRAVEL

When speaking of space travel, it is important to distinguish interplanetary travel from interstellar travel. Travel between planets is within the grasp of modern technology and is likely to become easier as science develops new fuel sources or new ways to maximize existing fuel sources. Travel between stars, on the other hand, calls for some truly radical leaps in a number of different fields.

## HAZARDS OF SPACE TRAVEL

Space travel is nowhere near as easy as books and movies make it seem.
Foreign objects are a constant danger; even a micrometeoroid traveling
at a high enough velocity can punch a hole through a starship’s hull and
expose the entire crew to the vacuum of space. Ionizing radiation also
poses a serious threat. Finally, characters must adapt to the
weightlessness of space or suffer the effects of space adaptation
syndrome (SAS), referred to colloquially as “space sickness.”

**METEOROIDS**

Meteoroids are small rocks that travel through space at a speed of 7
miles per second. They can be as small as a grain of sand or as big as a
mountain. Although they generally burn up in a planet’s atmosphere
before reaching the ground, meteoroids in space aren’t likely to suffer
such a fate. Instead, they slam into other objects, including starships
and space stations, like volleys of rifle or artillery fire.

Unarmored starships and space stations can easily survive impacts from
the smaller meteoroids, but larger ones can punch lethal holes in such
fragile vessels. Fortunately, large meteoroids are rare and easier to
detect before they can get too close to cause any real damage.

Roll on Table: Meteoroid Encounters to determine whether a meteoroid
threatens a given starship or space station. Each roll represents one
24-hour period.

**Meteoroid Size: **The size of the meteoroid.

**Collision Damage: **When a meteoroid collides with a starship,

space station, or other object, both the meteoroid and the object

it strikes take damage.

**Computer Use Check DC: **A starship or space station equipped with a
sensor system can detect an incoming meteoroid; doing so requires a
successful Computer Use check. A starship or space station cannot
attempt to avoid or destroy a meteoroid it fails to detect.

**Pilot Check DC: **Avoiding a meteoroid requires a successful Pilot
check. Only starships or space stations that move are capable of
avoiding meteoroids.

**Defense: **The meteoroid’s Defense.

**Hardness: **The meteoroid’s hardness.

**Hit Points: **The meteoroid’s total hit points.

### VACUUM EXPOSURE

Beings exposed to the airless cold of space are not immediately doomed.
Contrary to popular belief, characters exposed to vacuum do not
immediately freeze or explode, and their blood does not boil in their
veins. While space is very cold, heat does not transfer away from a body
that quickly. The real danger comes from suffocation and ionizing
radiation.

For rules on vacuum exposure and the effects of weightlessness, see
Atmospheric Conditions and Gravity in the Environments section.

**RADIATION**

Ionizing radiation is common in space. For the effects, see Radiation
Sickness in the Environments section.

## REENTRY

Anything that travels too fast in an atmosphere generates an enormous
amount of friction, which produces tremendous heat. (Temperatures of
2,280 degrees Fahrenheit have been recorded.) Objects trying to enter a
planetary atmosphere safely must shed velocity. However, decelerating
consumes large amounts of fuel, and many ships (especially at Progress
Level 5) simply don’t have enough. As an alternative, scientists have
developed ways to slow ships in reentry by using the atmospheric
friction itself. Ablative shielding or ceramic tiles take care of any
excess heat. Even so, entering a planet’s atmosphere is a tricky
business; the angle of entry is precise, and deviation either way causes
the heat to build up too quickly for the heat shields to reflect away
from the ship. Worse yet, during the most intense heating, the ship is
surrounded by a thin layer of plasma that blocks radio signals, and the
crew have no contact with ground control.

Entering planetary atmosphere safely requires a Pilot check (DC 20) each
round for the 1d10+20 rounds it takes to slow the ship using friction
alone. Success means that the ship takes only 3d6 points of fire damage
each round. Failure means that the ship’s angle is too low, and that it
is not shedding velocity fast enough; the ship takes 6d6 points of fire
damage each round until the pilot succeeds at the Pilot check to correct
the angle of descent. If the check fails by 5 or more, the angle is too
steep, and the ship takes 10d6 points of fire damage each round until
the pilot succeeds at the Pilot check to correct the angle. Each round
spent at too low an angle does not count toward the number of rounds
required to land the ship; the ship isn’t making any downward progress.
Conversely, each round spent at too steep an angle counts as 2 rounds,
indicating that the ship is descending much faster than it should.

## INTERPLANETARY TRAVEL

In Progress Level 5, humanity has the technology to send unmanned probes
to the edge of the solar system. However, human sojourns into space are
limited to orbital missions and trips to the Moon, as longer journeys
would take decades and consume ridiculous amounts of fuel and oxygen.

Interplanetary travel becomes possible at Progress Level 6. Ships fitted
with magnetic ram scoops allow the crew to manufacture fuel from
particles of hydrogen gas floating loose in space (though at only a few
atoms per cubic inch). Such a ship could even incorporate a particle
accelerator that converts matter into antimatter—with far more efficient
thrust-to-payload ratios than solid fuel. With a sufficient supply of
food, water, and oxygen, a ship so equipped could travel to the edges of
the solar system and perhaps to another solar system entirely.

## INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL

Realistically, the starships presented in the Starships section are
capable only of interplanetary travel, not interstellar travel. The
reason for this is simple: Even the best engine can’t accelerate a ship
to light speed, and without light speed, interstellar journeys take tens
of thousands of years. The speed of light is 186,000 miles per second.
That’s 1,116,000 miles per round, or 66,960,000 miles per hour.
Maneuvering a ship at this speed is a tricky proposition; by the time
you notice an object in your path, it’s probably too late to avoid it.
One must also consider relativity: The closer the ship’s velocity comes
to the speed of light, the greater its mass. A starship cannot achieve
light speed via simple acceleration, no matter how powerful the ship’s
engine, as increasing the power only increases the mass.

The greatest impediment to traveling between the stars is time: What
would be the point of sending astronauts to Alpha Centauri, for example,
if, by the time they arrived, no one on Earth could remember why they’d
gone in the first place? Time dilation—the slowing of the passage of
time in relation to an object traveling at close to the speed of
light—becomes a factor. A few years might pass on board the ship, while
a few hundred years might have passed both at the ship’s point of origin
and its point of arrival.

## REALISTIC TRAVEL TIMES

Table: Realistic Travel Times provides various “realistic”
interplanetary and interstellar travel times. These times assume that
starships cannot achieve velocities anywhere near the speed of light,
for reasons discussed under Interstellar Travel (see above). Using the
table, a starship equipped with a PL 6 ion engine would take 67.2 days
to travel from Earth to Mars, while the same ship equipped with a PL 7
induction engine would take 16.8 days.

The travel times listed are based on average distance. Planets move
closer together and farther apart based on their relative orbits around
the sun, and the travel time between worlds may increase or decrease
accordingly.

## TIME DILATION

When a ship approaches to within 90% of the speed of light, time slows
down. Characters on board the ship would not notice, but if they were to
make hourly reports back to their point of origin, those reports might
arrive only once every hundred hours.

This creates an interesting paradox, in that if a character managed to
travel at the speed of light to another star and back again, a newborn
child he left behind would now be older than him—if the child hadn’t
died of old age some time ago.

The actual amount of time dilation observed aboard a ship traveling near
light speed increases in proportion to just how close it is to light
speed. Technically, time dilation occurs at any speed, but it only
becomes noticeable at relativistic speeds. The dilation is a ratio that
determines how much time passes aboard the ship; it is a multiplier when
determining how much time passes outside the ship.

For example, a ship moving at 70% the speed of light has a time dilation
of 1.4. Ten hours of travel aboard the ship at this speed means that 14
hours (10 × 1.4) have passed outside the ship. However, if ten hours
pass for those left behind, only 7.1 hours have passed aboard the ship
(10 divided by 1.4).

## JUMP GATE TECHNOLOGY

If a starship cannot reach the speed of light through sheer thrust,
perhaps the answer lies in bending the laws of time and space so that
the distance itself is shorter. A ship could then get around the need to
travel at relativistic speeds, leaving behind the problem of increased
mass and negating—if not actually reversing— the effects of time
dilation. In other words, if one could find a shortcut through the
galaxy, it might be possible for spacecraft to travel quickly between
star systems, and perhaps even travel backward in time.

Shortcuts through space and time are called wormholes. Wormholes are
created naturally when black holes collapse, though they tend to close
so rapidly that a ship attempting to pass through would instead
encounter a singularity—a point with infinite density and a radius of
zero—and be instantly crushed. But, if the technology were developed to
enable a wormhole to remain open, it might become possible for
spaceships to enter wormholes, travel for a few million miles, and
emerge several light years away—perhaps at the point of a white hole.

White holes are theoretical objects that spew energy into the universe
from unknown sources. One theory suggests that quasistellar objects
(also known as quasars) are actually white holes, at the far end of
which might be wormholes. Thus, it is theoretically possible to enter a
wormhole in one location in the universe, and emerge from a white hole
in another. Such a stable conduit could be called a jump gate.

At Progress Level 5, the technology does not exist to stabilize
wormholes in order to create jump gates, though by PL 6 scientists might
have developed the technology to map the exit points of wormholes. With
a theoretical advance in astrophysics, humanity might be ready to make
the first safe jump by Progress Level 7.

Jump Holes

In theory, a collapsing wormhole in a strong enough gravitational field
could remain open of its own accord, creating a kind of natural jump
gate, or “jump hole.” The jump hole would function the same way as a
jump gate but could close while travelers are en route to the exit
point.

A jump hole might collapse while there are ships still traveling through
its jump space. Roll d% each hour; on a result of 100, the hole
collapses. If this happens, any ships in its jump space immediately drop
back into “real” space—most likely in the middle of nowhere. Determine
what percentage of the journey the ship had completed, then compare that
percentage to the real distance; this is how far from its destination
the ship is.

**JUMP GATE (PL 7)**

Jump gates consist of gigantic rings in space that use fusion reactors
to generate a magnetic field capable of holding open a collapsing
wormhole. This allows starships to enter the wormhole, engage their
engines, and reduce the effective travel distance to the wormhole’s exit
point by a factor of 1,000. For example, the 48,360,000-mile trip from
the Earth to Mars would be reduced to 48,360 miles via a jump gate
(assuming a wormhole had appeared near the Earth and that its exit point
was near Mars). Thus, a starship with PL 6 ion engines traveling through
“jump space” could reach Mars in approximately 1.6 hours (instead of
67.2 days) and completely avoid the effects of time dilation.

Jump gates have a few limitations:

• Jump gates have only one exit point. Therefore, a jump gate from Pluto
to Alpha Centauri is useless to characters who don’t want to go to Alpha
Centauri.

• Jump gates are one-way. The journey to the exit point might be
comparatively short, but the journey back could take just as long as it
always did—or require a circuitous route from jump gate to jump gate,
some of which could be dozens of light years out of the way.

• Jump gates are rarely located near one another. A starship might have
to cross an entire system to get from one exit point to the next jump
gate.

• Maneuvering a jump gate into position requires a successful Navigate
check (DC 35). If this check fails by 5 or more, the jump gate collides
with the closing wormhole and is crushed against the forming
singularity.

In PL 7, jump gates are most likely owned by megacorporations that
charge for their use. The toll varies according to the real distance
between the jump gate and the exit point: Divide the real distance by
1,000,000 miles to determine the purchase DC for passage through the
jump gate.

**Purchase DC: **75 (per jump gate).

**Restriction: **Licensed (+1).

**JUMP NETWORK (PL 8)**

As science develops ways to harness the power of singularities,
astrophysicists apply the technology to wormholes. A jump network is a
series of jump gates that can each serve as an entry or exit point.
Thus, jump gates are no longer one-way: A jump gate can take a ship from
the Earth to Mars and back. Further, the network could also include jump
gates leading to and from Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto.

Jump gates in the network are still expensive, but the risk of placing
one has completely vanished; the jump gate merely has to be moved into
the desired position—usually a Lagrange point—and switched on.

Many gates in the jump network are owned by megacorporations, who charge
for their use. Some gates are operated by the military and have
restricted access. However, the gates between common locations like
planets and stars are government owned and designated for public use.

**Purchase DC: **75 (per jump gate).

**Restriction: **Licensed (+1).

**JUMP DRIVE (PL 9)**

The jump drive is a portable version of a jump gate. Ships carrying a
jump drive can create a stable, though temporary, wormhole. The
artificial wormhole lasts until the ship that created it emerges from
the exit point.

The jump drive suffers from one major limitation. Once a ship has
entered jump space, it has only two real options: continue to the exit
point or deactivate the jump drive. The ship cannot change course while
in jump space; it must drop out of jump space, set a new course, and
re-engage the jump drive. The drawback to this is that jump drives
require a lot of energy; recharging the drive takes hours, as shown on
Table: Jump Drive Recharge Time.

## FANTASTIC SPACE TRAVEL

A campaign needn’t limit itself to relativistic speeds and time
dilation. You can jump right into the “high adventure” side of space
travel.

## FASTER-THAN-LIGHT (FTL) DRIVES

Early in Progress Level 7, the development of artificial gravity
technology spawns the induction engine, and scientists quickly learn to
apply the technology to faster-than-light travel. The early “stardrives”
are not truly capable of reaching light speed but offer a vast
improvement over conventional engines. Humanity can finally reach
distant stars in mere weeks, advancing space exploration and
colonization, as well as reaching out to contact and trade with
intelligent alien life.

## FANTASTIC TRAVEL TIMES

Travel times at relativistic speeds are generally easy to calculate.
Simply determine how long it takes to arrive at the destination while
traveling at the speed of light, then divide the result by the light
speed multiplier of the drive being used. Some sample travel times
appear in Table: Fantastic Travel Times.

######### TELEPORTATION

The earliest teleportation devices move only simple substances, with
uniform molecular structures. As the technology improves, teleporting
more complex matter becomes possible. At Progress Level 8, living
organic matter can pass more or less safely through teleporters. At
Progress Level 9, the range of matter transference increases to cover
galactic distances.

## TELEPORTERS

As with stardrives, multiple types of teleporters can exist, depending
on the technology used to develop them.

**TRANSPORT BOOTH (PL 8)**

Based on original teleportation technology, a transport booth is simply
a booth large enough to accommodate a single Medium-size creature or
Huge object, with controls on the outside. An operator selects the
destination booth (which is any other transport booth), waits for a
clear signal from the destination, then transmits. Anything inside the
booth is disassembled at the molecular level, translated into electronic
data, and transmitted. The speed of the transmission depends on the
communication technology used, but even with the least effective
communications, any distance of less than 1,000 miles is virtually
instantaneous.

*Radio Transceiver (PL 5): *A transport booth equipped with a radio
transceiver can teleport its contents to a receiving booth positioned
within 240,000 miles (roughly the distance between Earth and the Moon).
Since light travels at a speed of 186,000 miles per second, the
transport is nearly instantaneous.

*Laser Transceiver (PL 6): *A transport booth equipped with a laser
transceiver can teleport its contents to a receiving booth at any
distance. However, the transmission travels at a speed of 8 AU/hour (or
744,000,000 miles/hour), making it practical only for interplanetary
transport.

*Mass Transceiver (PL 7): *A transport booth equipped with a mass
transceiver can teleport its contents to a receiving booth
instantaneously. The maximum range of the transmission is 1,000 AU
(roughly 93,000,000,000 miles).

*Drive Transceiver (PL 8): *A transport booth equipped with a drive
transceiver can teleport its contents to a receiving booth within 1,000
AU (roughly 93,000,000,000 miles). The transport is virtually
instantaneous.

*Ansible (PL 9): *A transport booth equipped with an ansible can
teleport its contents to a receiving booth across interstellar space.
The teleport occurs instantaneously, and the range of the transport
booth is effectively unlimited. If the transport booth operator attempts
to transmit before he gets a clear signal from the receiving booth, any
living creature involved in the teleport must make a Fortitude save (DC
20). If the save fails, the living being immediately drops to –1 hit
points and begins to die. Even if the save succeeds, the creature takes
2d4 points of Constitution damage. In either case, the teleported
creature reaches the intended destination.

The purchase DC of a transport booth does not include the cost of the
communication technology used to transmit the matter (see Table:
Transport Booth Purchase DC Modifiers).

**Purchase DC: **31 (per transport booth) + the communication system’s
purchase DC modifier (see Table: Transport Booth Purchase DC Modifiers).

**Restriction: **Licensed (+1).

**TRANSPORTAL (PL 8)**

The transportal is a contained teleportation field. Creatures step into
it, and moments later they step out on the far side in a different
location. The technology only allows transport from one transportal to
another, though it is stable enough to remain open for several minutes
with each activation and only requires about 30 minutes to recharge
between activations. The only major drawback of the transportal is that
it tends to disorient travelers. Any creature using a transportal must
succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 15) or be shaken for 1d6 rounds upon
arrival.

**Purchase DC: **58 per transportal.

**Restriction: **Licensed (+1).

**TRANSPORT DISK (PL 9)**

The general technology of teleportation advances at Progress Level 9, to
the point where a receiving station is no longer necessary. The traveler
stands upon a disk on the floor, and the operator uses sensor technology
to pinpoint the traveler’s target destination. Pinpointing the target
destination requires a successful Navigate check, and the DC depends on
the distance traveled (see Table: Check DCs for Transport Disks).
Attempting to pinpoint the location without the aid of sensor technology
imposes a –20 penalty on the Navigate check.

When the operator transmits, any creature or object standing on the
transport disk is instantly sent to the location the operator has
selected. If the operator’s Navigate check fails by 10 or less, the
teleported creature or object appears in a location 1d100 miles from the
intended destination (determined randomly). If the check fails by 11 or
more, the teleported creature or object materializes inside solid matter
at some location 1d100 miles from the intended destination. Any living
creature teleported into solid matter takes 20d6 points of damage, or
half damage if a Fortitude save (DC 20) succeeds. It must also be freed
from whatever she has materialized inside of.

Although the chance of a botched transmission is daunting to some,
transport disks offer a tremendous advantage. With a successful Computer
Use check (see Table: Check DCs for Transport Disks), a transport disk
operator can locate a particular creature or object with computer
sensors and teleport it from its present location to the transport disk.
The range is limited only by the range of the sensors.

**Purchase DC: **52.

**Restriction: **Restricted (+2).

## DIMENSIONAL TRAVEL

Humankind has long been fascinated with the idea of parallel dimensions,
the theory being that alongside our own universe lie virtually identical
universes in which people just like us live out their lives (and perhaps
fantasize about parallel dimensions). The popular notion is that in a
parallel dimension, some different decision was made, some random event
occurred differently, or that some element in the composition of the
Earth is more common—and, as a result, the universe is different to some
degree or another. What if Wellington lost the Battle of Waterloo? What
if the cataclysm that wiped out the dinosaurs never happened? What if
Hitler conquered the world?

Of course, it could all be considerably more subtle than all that;
perhaps all humans have gray eyes, and that’s the only difference. The
point is that in alternate realities, life could be different. Without
ever leaving their home world, dimensional explorers could face
challenges every bit as daunting as the challenges faced by space
explorers.

## HAZARDS OF DIMENSIONAL TRAVEL

Any initial exploration of parallel dimensions must logically proceed
from a fixed location, because the amount of energy required would not
allow for a portable power source. Thus, as with interstellar travel,
early interdimensional trips are likely to be one-way. Fortunately, if a
beachhead can be established in another dimension, it should be a simple
matter for subsequent expeditions to transport the materials necessary
for the construction of another power source. It is in establishing that
beachhead that the real risk lies.

Initial dimensional journeys are unlikely to be carried out by humans,
but rather by probes designed to test the gravity, radiation levels,
atmosphere, pressure, and temperature—and to bring back samples of
microorganisms—to ensure that humans can survive, and that they are
properly equipped. Such probes must be tethered to the original
dimension to send back information (since there is no indication that
communication signals would travel back any more easily than objects
could).

The use of probes, however, should allow dimensional physicists to
develop a kind of “matrix map.” Not only can they note which dimensions
are hostile to human life, but, with sufficient data points, they can
extrapolate which dimension “frequencies” are likely to prove conducive
to human life. The first human dimensional travelers are likely to be
extremely well prepared for the environmental conditions they encounter.

Other factors may prove more hazardous, however. In addition to the
perils of first contact with a xenophobic populace, dimension travelers
must contend with the possibility of equipment failure, dimensional
static, scale variance, and encounters with other travelers who might
not be friendly.

**EQUIPMENT FAILURE**

As the science of dimensional travel advances, explorers carry portable
dimension gate generators, enabling them to come and go through
dimensions as they please. If that equipment fails for some reason, the
expedition might be trapped, possibly without the means to repair the
damaged generator.

Dimension gate generators—whether stationary or portable— should not
break down at random any more than a starship does (unless, of course,
the campaign revolves around that very problem).

**Complete Shutdown: **The generator simply stops working, either
because its components are damaged or because it has run out of power.
Fixing damage components usually requires 10 hours and a successful
Repair check (DC 25), while constructing a new power source (a complex
device) requires 60 hours and a successful Craft (electronic) check (DC
25). Locating a replacement power source in a civilized area may require
a successful Gather Information check, and negotiating for it may
require a Diplomacy check.

**Miscalibration: **A miscalibrated dimension gate generator doesn’t
take the characters where they planned to go. Correctly recalibrating
the generator involves either downloading the data from another
functional generator (a full-round action followed by a successful DC 10
Computer Use check) or returning to the last “accurate coordinates” and
resetting the matrix (12 hours of work followed by a successful DC 25
Computer Use check).

**Communication Failure: **There is no guarantee that standard
communications work across dimensions; even communications designed to
work across interstellar distances are useless when the party for whom
the message is intended is not in the same dimension. A d-com (see
Dimensional Communicators, below) or similar device enables
communication across dimensions.

**DIMENSIONAL STATIC**

Dimensions are constantly splitting into new dimensions as events create
alternate realities. These divergences release tremendous amounts of
energy, which manifests as a kind of “static” during dimension gate
operations. Generators are designed to filter out this noise and lock
onto the specific “signal” of the intended destination. However, if the
generator isn’t getting enough power, or if the static level is
extremely high, the gateway between dimensions is less stable.

Traveling through an unstable gate is potentially fatal. The traveler
must make a Fortitude save (DC 15). If the check succeeds, the character
arrives at the intended destination but is stunned for 1d4 rounds. If
the check fails, the character arrives on target but is nauseated for
1d4 hours. If the save fails by 5 or more, the character arrives on
target, takes 2d6 points of Constitution damage, and is nauseated for
1d4 hours.

**SCALE VARIANCE**

A potential risk in traveling to other dimensions is a matter of size:
Is everything in the other dimension on the same scale as the travelers
who visit it? A scale variance can be simulated by changing a
character’s effective size. For example, a Medium-size character might
be considered Fine in the new dimension. Such a variance, of course,
changes the character’s size modifier to attack rolls and Defense. Speed
also changes, multiplied by a factor based on the change in size: Fine
×0.16, Diminutive ×0.33, Tiny ×0.5, Small ×0.66, Medium-size ×1, Large
×1.33, Huge ×2, Gargantuan ×2.66, Colossal ×3.33.

The damage a character deals with natural and artificial weapons also
scales with size. For every step by which a character’s size category
increases or decreases, increase or decrease the damage by one step: 1,
1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 2d6, 3d6, 4d6, 6d6, 8d6, 12d6. Attacks that
deal 2d4 points of damage scale down to 1d6 or up to 2d6. Attacks that
deal 1d10 points of damage scale down to 1d8 and up to 2d6. Attacks that
deal 1d12 points of damage scale down to 1d8 and up to 3d6.

**DIMENSIONAL OPPONENTS**

If humans are capable of traveling through dimensions, it is reasonable
to believe that intelligent beings, either from other worlds or other
dimensions, also have this capability. Other dimensional travelers might
not be friendly. They might be raiders, plundering other dimensions for
the resources they lack in their own. They could just as easily be
transdimensional traffic police, tasked with detecting and disabling
unauthorized dimension gate generators. They could simply be savage
monsters, naturally capable of dimensional travel and drawn to unusual
interdimensional activity.

## DIMENSION GATE GENERATORS

The technology behind dimension gates is highly advanced. The first
working gates are treated as late Progress Level 7 technology, and
concerted human exploration of alternative dimensions begins at Progress
Level 8. The calculations required for dimensional travel are complex,
but the calculations for *safe *travel—arriving at the intended
destination with no loss of carrier signal—are tens of thousands of
times more complex.

Actually traveling through a dimension gate is easy, but changing the
setting is more complex. A character must succeed on a Navigate check
(DC 30) to reset the gate to a known destination; setting the gate to an
unknown (but safe) destination is a DC 40 Navigate check. (These checks
should be rolled secretly.) Performing either check requires 30 minutes
of calibration. Of course, if the destinations have been preset, any
character can change the settings as a move action without making a
check.

Dimension gate generators come in a variety of forms, each operating
somewhat differently.

**D-GATE GENERATOR (PL 7–9)**

The first dimension gate generators—appearing at Progress Level 7— are
Gargantuan objects that cannot be transported once assembled. The PL 7
D-gate creates a transdimensional aperture approximately 10 feet in
diameter and allows for one-way transport only. Due to the incredible
power drain, the gate remains open for only 1 round, after which the
generator shuts down and cannot be activated again for 24 hours.

The PL 8 D-gate is a Huge object weighing 200 pounds, but due to its
bulk, the generator requires at least two people to lift and haul it. It
creates a transdimensional aperture up to 20 feet in diameter, and the
generator can keep the gate open for up to 10 rounds, after which the
generator shuts down and cannot be activated again for 24 hours.
Dimensional mapping makes calculations to reset the gate’s destination
easier (Navigate check, DC 25), and any given gate can store up to five
predetermined destinations. Travel is still one-way, but with the larger
aperture and the destination presets, the equipment to construct another
D-gate can be transported through, and the travelers’ home dimension can
be locked into the new gate upon startup.

At PL 9, D-gates large enough to transport starships exist (although
they can be almost any size), and they can store up to twenty
predetermined destinations. The calculations are even easier (Navigate
check, DC 20), and scientists have finally learned how to keep the gate
open indefinitely. Best of all, dimensional travel through PL 9 D-gates
is two-way, allowing for round trips.

**Purchase DC: **54 (PL 7 D-gate generator), 48 (PL 8 D-gate generator),
46 (PL 9 D-gate generator).

**Restriction: **Military (+3).

**D-DRIVE GENERATOR (PL 8–9)**

The D-drive generator can be incorporated into a starship’s engine
design, allowing the ship to travel between dimensions. Considered the
safest form of dimensional travel, D-drive generators allow ships in
space to cross dimensions. Due to the enormous power drain, the Ddrive
generator shuts down for 12 hours after the dimensional jump is
completed. In addition, the starship’s weapon systems, defense fields,
defense screens, and engines shut down for 2 hours. At Progress Level 8,
only Colossal starships can be fitted with a D-drive generator. Progress
Level 9 sees many improvements in the D-drive generator.

Any size starship can be equipped with one, and the generator can be
reactivated after 6 hours; the ship’s disabled weapons, defense fields,
defense screens, and engines come back online after only 10 minutes.

**Purchase DC: **48 (PL 8 D-drive generator), 44 (PL 9 D-drive
generator).

**Restriction: **Military (+3).

**DIMENSION WAND (PL 8–9)**

The dimension wand is a personal dimension gate generator. It creates a
rupture in the fabric of reality just large enough for one character to
step through into another dimension. The gate remains open until the
wand itself passes through, so multiple characters can step through
without using their own wands. The drawback to the dimension wand is
that it must be recalibrated after each use (see Equipment Failure,
above), or entirely new dimensional coordinates must be entered, as
though changing the settings. The PL 8 version of the dimension wand
weighs only 1 pound. The PL 9 version has the same purchase DC, with the
added benefit that it stores the last five dimensional coordinates
automatically, enabling anyone to thumb through settings without
recalibrating the wand.

**Weight: **1 lb.

**Purchase DC: **42.

**Restriction: **Restricted (+2).

## OTHER GEAR

In addition to dimension generators, most dimensional travelers at
Progress Level 8 and beyond carry dimensional transceivers, which

**DIMENSIONAL TRANSCEIVER (PL 8)**

A dimensional transceiver permits two-way communication across
dimensions, although dimensional static can sometimes hinder or block
communications. The somewhat bulky PL 8 transceiver can be carried like
a backpack; a handheld version is available at PL 9.

A dimensional transceiver must be calibrated to transmit signals to a
given dimension. Assuming the coordinates have already been plotted
using some kind of dimension generator (see above), calibrating the
transceiver takes a full-round action and requires a successful Computer
Use check (DC 15), The PL 9 version can store the coordinates of up to
five different dimensions.

**Size: **Medium (PL 8), Tiny (PL 9).

**Weight: **4 lb. (PL 8), 1 lb. (PL 9)

**Purchase DC: **24.

**Restriction: **Restricted (+2).

## TIME TRAVEL

The dream of time travel probably arose out of a desire to go back and
correct one’s past mistakes—or to visit the future and subsequently
return to take advantage of foreknowledge. The concept intrigues
historians and archaeologists for obvious reasons. Science fiction has
explored the possibility of time travel many times, as well as the
pitfalls of visiting the past and impacting the future.

Technically, time travel—of the “into the future” sort—is within the
realm of possibility. In fact, it happens all the time—just on such a
small scale that no one notices. Given that a starship engine could be
developed that accelerates a ship to relativistic speeds at which time
dilation occurs, time travel can be achieved simply by achieving 90% of
the speed of light for a short time, then returning to one’s point of
origin. For every minute you spend flying at 90% the speed of light, 2.3
minutes pass everywhere else. Travel at relativistic speeds long enough
and you could return to a time predating the rise of human civilization!

Traveling into the future isn’t a very useful ability if one has no way
back—which is where the concept of traveling into the past breaks down.
The principle of causality rather logically argues that an effect cannot
occur before its cause—meaning, in this case, that one cannot arrive in
the past via the use of a time machine before that time machine is
invented.

## HAZARDS OF TIME TRAVEL

The time machine is perhaps more dangerous than any other technology
that manipulates space and time. Not only can unscrupulous people use it
to wreak havoc in the past and take advantage of knowledge from the
future, but a single misstep could forever alter the course of history.

**TEMPORAL PARADOXES**

Trips through time are exercises in causality. Traveling into the past
might set in motion a chain of actions culminating in different major
historical events. Characters might return to the present to discover
that the Roman emperor Caligula used intercontinental ballistic missiles
to conquer Europe and the Middle East. Conceivably, history could be
altered in a way that prompts the Soviet Union to invade and conquer
North America. Perhaps the characters can’t even return to their own
time because the person who invented the crucial component of the time
machine was never born, for some reason. In short, the permutations of
cause and effect can be infinitely mind-boggling.

Temporal paradoxes are liable to stall the development of time travel
until someone can prove either that (a) actions in the past by people
from the present have, in fact, already happened (and that it was those
actions that led to the current state of affairs), or (b) actions in the
past that affect the present can be detected and averted by sending
someone else into the past to prevent those actions from happening.

**ALTERNATE REALITIES**

Another potential side-effect of time travel popularized in literature
is the alternate reality. The timestream in which time travel is
invented continues to exist. Situations that create significant changes
or temporal paradoxes serves as the locus or intersection point where
realities diverge.

The time travelers might encounter worlds very similar to or different
from their own. This creates a rich diversity of settings where the
established “facts” and “rules” are no longer sure. The nefarious
villain recently defeated in a different reality might be a trustworthy
ally in this one. A temporal adventurer might encounter a dead companion
who did not die in this alternate reality. The possible permutations are
infinite.

**EVER-CHANGING LANDSCAPES**

Time machines that do not actually move are at the mercy of
topographical changes and other changes in the locations in which they
appear. Never mind that one couldn’t construct a time machine in New
Mexico and use it to visit Jerusalem in the year A.D. 33. Traveling into
the past might deposit you in the middle of a rushing river or under
thousands of tons of glacial ice. Traveling into the future, you might
find that the position occupied by your time machine now resides in the
basement of a futuristic skyscraper or in the middle of a radioactive
wasteland covered by ice—the result of an extraordinarily heavy and
sustained nuclear bombardment.

**LANGUAGE**

Modern language is loaded with slang, jargon, and colloquialisms that
would mean nothing to people who lived in the 19th century. Their slang,
jargon, and colloquialisms, by the same token, would mean nothing to
those who lived in the 18th century. Go back another thousand years, and
the words you are reading right now would be all but incomprehensible to
the average English- speaking person—assuming he or she could read. Your
speech would be equally incomprehensible. Go forward a thousand years,
and the English of the new millennium will barely resemble the English
of this millennium. Without a Speak Language or Read/Write Language
skill for the appropriate era, communication could more closely resemble
a game of charades.

**AGE**

Those who travel in time age normally within their own localized time.
So, while eons may pass in the eye blink it takes to travel through
them, the time traveler feels none of the effects of aging. However,
this can work against the traveler. If he were to spend twenty years in
his own timeframe exploring the centuries, then return to his starting
point, he would, in fact, be twenty years older than he was when he
left.

## TIME MACHINES

Temporal displacement drives—colloquially known as “time machines”—do
not exist until Progress Level 8. The first time machines are faintly
reminiscent of the brass, ivory, and quartz machine invented by H.G.
Wells in his novel *The Time Machine*, though made of lightweight
aluminum and resembling something more like bathyspheres. Those that
follow are constructed as fixed tunnels leading to nowhere, while those
mounted in starships turn the entire ship into the time machine.

**TIME SPHERE (PL 8)**

Time spheres are small, two-seated modules designed to withstand any
reasonable amount of buffeting that might occur when the machine finally
comes to rest in a different time period. At the very least, the
self-contained atmosphere should give the occupants time to “reverse
course” should they discover that conditions outside are too hostile to
disembark. The time sphere carries sensors designed to test outside
conditions immediately upon arrival.

The temporal displacement mechanism itself is arranged around the inside
of the sphere, giving the occupants full access to the electronics in
case of emergency. The main computer has all programs necessary to
operate the machine and is crammed with historical and linguistic
information, electronic encyclopedias, and any other information that
might be necessary to survive in a different time. Operation of the time
sphere is quite simple for characters familiar with computers. One
simply sets the desired date and time and presses the “Go” button.

Time spheres are not sold commercially. In fact, doing so is illegal,
but the plans to construct them are quite common. The components have a
total purchase DC of 36. Building a time sphere chassis takes 12 hours
and requires a successful Craft (mechanical) skill check (DC 25).
Building and filling the time sphere’s computer (a much more daunting
exercise) takes 120 hours and requires a successful Craft (electronic)
check (DC 35).

Time spheres have the following statistics:

**Crew **2; **Passengers **0; **Cargo **120 lb.; **Defense **6;
**Hardness **5; **Hit Points **24; **Size **Huge; **Purchase DC: **65;
**Restriction: **Illegal (+4).

**TEMPORAL DRIVE GENERATOR (PL 9)**

Like the D-drive generator, which is designed to carry starships across
dimensional boundaries, the temporal drive generator (or “T-drive
generator”) carries starships through time. The drive can be mounted in
a starship of any size and turns the entire ship into a time machine.

**Purchase DC: **60.

**Restriction: **Military (+3).

**TIME BRIDGE (PL 9)**

Doing away with the issue of portability, the time bridge opens a portal
to both other times *and *other places. The time bridge also has the
advantage of not leaving a fragile piece of vital equipment lying about
while its operators go exploring. Instead, the travelers use a simple
“message-drop” system to communicate with their base of operations: Upon
arrival, they conceal a small transmitter somewhere near their point of
embarkation. They then have a prearranged amount of time to explore and
return to the location to catch the next appearance of the time bridge.
If they do not return, an operative from their base emerges to search
for the transmitter.

Assuming he finds it, the operative records a message on the
transmitter, letting the explorers know when the bridge will reappear
again, or he collects any recorded message the explorers might have left
indicating where and when to pick them up. The process repeats until the
explorers are brought back safely.

Travel through the time bridge is comparable to walking through a
tunnel. Operators at the base set the temporal and physical coordinates
at the other end, and a team of travelers walks into the tunnel and
seems to vanish. For the travelers, the point of origin simply becomes
less “real” as the destination becomes more real. The bridge is large
enough to accommodate vehicles up to Huge size.
