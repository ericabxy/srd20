## Shadowy Bays & Drop-offs (EL 4+ warning zones)

Marker ! toward the deep-facing edges. The shallows suddenly drop off into deep, dark water. Temperatures drop and sounds mute.

The locals say "We do not fish there.", "The water pulls.", and "Something waits."

Encounters are preceded by ominous signs, which if not heeded lead to escalation.

_The Green Fade (D6):_ Crossing between the shallows "=" and open water "~" there is a sudden increase in depth. Water darkens and locals are cautious. EL 4+ wandering encounters.

In open water "~" the surface is still, fewer signs of life, fauna are hiding. EL 4&ndash;5 wandering encounters are a danger if party does not take care to avoid it.

#### The Watching Deep (E6)

A dramatic drop-off into open ocean (every space beyond open water "~"). EL 6+ encounters represent the threat of venturing across the deep. Not intended for combat.
