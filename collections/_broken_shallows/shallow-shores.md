Shattershoal Shore (EL 1 to 3)

- Knee- to waist-deep waters
- Living reefs
- Clear sightlines
- Countless hiding places

Locathah Homeland (L): Clustered semi-aquatic villages built into reef shelves and tidal pools; connected by rope bridges, coral tunnels, and kelp markers(?).

Avoided by deep predators, mostly EL 1 to 2. One or two "known dangers" of EL 3. Threats here are locally "managed". Locathah warn of dangers tied to specific hexes, cultural taboos about certain waters, all related through oral maps based on landmarks.
