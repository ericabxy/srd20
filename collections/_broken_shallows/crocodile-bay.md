The open water on and surrounding this tile (~) is inhabited by a population of crocodiles. Creatures venturing more than 10 feet from the edge of shallow water may be attacked by 1d3 crocodiles who attempt to drag prey into the water. Encounter Level: 4--5.

__Crocodile (1--3):__ Medium Animal; HD 3d8+9 (22 hp); Init +1; Spd 20 ft., swim 30 ft.; AC 15, touch 11, flat-footed 14; BAB +2/+6; Atk bite +6 melee (1d8+6) or tail slap +6 melee (1d12+6); 5 ft./5 ft.; SV Fort +6, Ref +4, Will +2; AS Str 19, Dex 12, Con 17, Int 1, Wis 12, Cha 2.

_Skills and Feats:_ Hide +7*, Listen +4, Spot +4, Swim +12; alertness, skill focus (Hide).

*A crocodile gains a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks when in the water. Further, a crocodile can lie in the water with only its eyes and nostrils showing, gaining a +10 cover bonus on Hide checks.

_Improved Grab (Ex):_ To use this ability, a crocodile must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, the crocodile establishes a hold on the opponent with its mouth and drags it into deep water, attempting to pin it to the bottom.

_Hold Breath (Ex):_ A crocodile can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 × its Constitution score before it risks drowning.

_Low-light Vision:_ A crocodile can see twice as far as normal in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. It retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

_Swim Speed:_ A crocodile has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

After An Encounter (Optional)
------------------

If one or more crocodiles are killed, this encounter does not occur again until the next tide-cycle. The crocs have temporarily moved to another hunting ground within the bay, which is roughly 4 square miles of territory.

Local Hunters (Optional)
-------------

Sometimes, instead of crocodiles, the player-characters may encounter locathah hunters in this are. If examined or questioned, they may reveal that they're monitoring the crocodile population and waiting for an appropriate time to hunt and kill one for the village stores.

__Locathah Hunter (2-4):__ War 4; Medium-size humanoid (aquatic); HD 4d8 (18 hp); Init +1; Spd 10 ft., swim 60 ft.; AC 14 (+1 Dex, +3 natural); BA/G +4/+1; Atk Longspear +5 melee (1d8/×3); 5 ft./5 ft.; SV Fort +5, Ref +1, Will +1; AS Str 10, Dex 12, Con 10, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 11.

_Skills and Feats:_ Craft (TODO) +6, Listen +7, Spot +7, Swim +8; Weapon Focus (longspear).

_Swim Speed:_ A locathah has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
