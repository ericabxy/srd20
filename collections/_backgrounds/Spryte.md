## Spryte Racial Traits

* Sprytes receive a +2 racial bonus to Dexterity and a –2 racial penalty to Strength (these modifications stack with either loresong or quickling modifiers).
* Fey: Sprytes are no longer humanoid in type, but Fey.
* Tiny: Because they are Tiny creatures, sprytes gain a +2 size bonus to Armor Class and attack rolls (instead of the +1 bonus they had while Small), and a +8 size bonus to all Sneak checks (instead of the +4 bonus they had while Small). They must use Tiny-sized weapons and equipment, and can lift and carry only half as much as Medium characters. Despite being Tiny, sprytes still occupy a 5-foot by 5-foot area, threaten the areas around them, and do not need to enter another’s area to make a melee attack.
* Spryte base speed is 10 feet.
* Flight: Sprytes have thin, transparent wings that allow them to fly with a speed of 30, with average maneuverability. See page 141 for more information on flying maneuverability.
* Low-Light Vision: All faen can see twice as far as humans in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
* Racial Levels: Unlike quicklings and loresongs, sprytes can take a few levels in “spryte” as a class to further master the aspects of their new form.

### Spryte Levels

Sprytes can take up to three levels in “spryte” at any time. Each level represents the spryte mastering more facets of the new form. Not all sprytes take racial levels (or all three of them). Spryte levels stack with a spellcasting class level for purposes of determining caster level for spells. If the spryte has two spellcasting classes, the spryte levels add to the higher of the two class levels. Innate spell-like abilities gained through spryte levels use the character level as the caster level. The spryte can use the normal and diminished versions of these spells, but not the heightened versions, except for charm.
