Faen (Quickling) Racial Traits
------------------------------

* Quickling faen receive a +2 racial bonus to Dexterity and a –2 racial penalty to Strength.
* Faen base speed is 20 feet.
* __Small:__ Because they are Small creatures, all faen gain a +1 size bonus to Armor Class and attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus to all Sneak checks. They must use smaller-sized weapons and equipment, and can lift and carry only three-quarters as much as a Medium character.
* __Run:__ When a quickling runs, he moves five times his normal speed rather than four times. Quicklings cannot use this racial ability when wearing Heavy armor.
* Faen are light-footed and quiet when they wish to be, earning them a +2 racial bonus on Sneak checks.
* As quicklings are extremely nimble and react fast, they enjoy a +1 racial bonus to initiative checks.
* __Low-Light Vision:__ Faen can see twice as far as humans in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
* __Metamorphosis:__ Once a faen has achieved at least 3rd character level (in any class[es]), she may choose to undergo a metamorphosis. This can occur only at a time when she would normally gain a new or bonus feat—the metamorphosis is in lieu of the feat. The faen secretes a sticky substance that she wraps around herself. The secretion hardens, forming a chrysalis. The faen then spends 1d4+3 days in the chrysalis, after which she emerges in a completely different form. Even smaller than before, the faen now has gossamer wings that can carry her aloft. She has become a spryte. A faen’s gear taken into the magical chrysalis emerges sized appropriately for the character’s new stature.
* __Automatic Languages:__ Common and Faen.
* __Bonus Languages:__ Any.
