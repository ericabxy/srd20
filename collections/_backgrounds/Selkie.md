Selkie
------

A selkie is a semiaquatic medium humanoid with the shapechanger subtype. Its natural form resembles that of a seal with a human upper-body.

### Selkie Traits

Selkie characters possess the following racial traits.

__Medium:__ No special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

__Shapechanger Subtype:__ A selkie has the ability to transform into a human with a land speed of 30 feet.

__Speed:__ A selkie’s base land speed is 5 feet. Swim speed 50 feet.

__Skills:__ A selkie has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

__Hold Breath:__ A selkie can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 6 &times; its Con score before it risks drowning.

__Change Shape:__ A selkie can assume its human form, or revert to its natural form, as a standard action. In human form, a selkie has no swim speed and loses its requisite benefits to Swim checks, but gains a land speed of 30 feet. A selkie remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, but the selkie reverts to its natural form when killed. A *true seeing* spell reveals its natural form.

__Automatic Languages:__ Common, Aquan. Bonus Languages: Draconic, Elven, Gnoll, Goblin, Orc, Sahuagin, Sylvan.

__Favored Class:__ Bard.
