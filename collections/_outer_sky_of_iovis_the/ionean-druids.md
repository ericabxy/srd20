title: Ionean Druids
---

Druids on Ione are civic ecologists who study, monitor, and pass down knowledge about the slow terraforming process. Not only do they know how to rest soil, maintain migration corridors, and regulate aquifers; they also understand how ecosystems and water cycles must be allowed to collapse and regrow, making many druids seem indifferent to suffering and anthropocentric survival.

Key Nature Preserves:

The Driftline, a shifting band of terrain at the edge of the atmospheric barrier where feedback patterns between the terraforming machine and ecological processes are unpredictable.

The Cinder Wells, natural-seeming sinkholes that are actually runoff vents for chemical-laced groundwater. Many druids spend time here monitoring local genetic adaptations and introducing or culling vital organisms for arcane purposes.

The Quiet Groves, artificial biomes in The Ashen Reach that are designed to collapse over time in a complicated and delicate biofeedback pattern.
