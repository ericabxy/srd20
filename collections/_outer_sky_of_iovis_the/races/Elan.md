Special Qualities
-----------------

Once per day, an elan can activate one of the following supernatural abilities.

__Repletion (Su):__ By expending 1 use, an elan does not need to eat or drink for 24 hours.

__Resilience (Su):__ As an immediate action, an elan can reduce the damage he is about to take by 2 points for every 1 use spent.

__Resistance (Su):__ As an immediate action, an élan can spend 1 use to gain a +4 racial bonus on saving throws until the beginning of his next turn.

Additionally an elan spellcaster can "lose" a prepared spell or daily spell slot to gain extra uses of these abilities. All of the uses from a "lost" spell must be spent immediately.
