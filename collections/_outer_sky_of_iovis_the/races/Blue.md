Blues are small primates with bat-like faces and fine coats of fur. While they used to be primarily gray and silver, blue coats now come in a variety of colors. Blues are excellent climbers and their buildings and craft reflect this aptitude by featuring high hides, handholds, ladders, and ropes.

--- --2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, --2 Charisma

--- Small size: As small creatures, blues gain a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks, but they use smaller weapons than normal, and their lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.

--- Base land speed is 20 feet.

--- Climb speed of 20 feet.

--- Low-light vision: Blues can see twice as far as normal in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

--- Naturally Magic: Blue spellcasters gain bonus spells as if the governing ability score were 1 point higher. This benefit does not grant them the ability to cast spells unless they gain that ability through levels in a spellcaster class.

--- +4 genetic bonus on Jump checks.

--- Special Qualities: Climb speed.

Special Qualities
-----------------

__Climb Speed:__ As a creature with a climb speed, blues have a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. Blues must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC of more than 0, but it always can choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened while climbing. If it chooses an accelerated climb, it moves at double its climb speed and makes a single Climb check at a -5 penalty. It cannot run while climbing. It retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus on their attacks against a climbing blue. Also, blues add their Dexterity modifier to Climb checks instead of their Strength modifier.
