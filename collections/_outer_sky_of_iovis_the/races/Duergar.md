--- +2 Constitution, --2 Charisma.

--- Medium-size: As medium creatures, duren have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

--- Duren base land speed is 20 feet. However, duren can move at this speed even when wearing medium or heavy gear or when carrying a medium or heavy load (unlike other creatures, whose speed is reduced in such situations).

--- Darkvision out to 60 feet.

--- +2 genetic bonus on saving throws against poison.

--- +2 genetic bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects.

--- +4 genetic bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of heat, cold, air/water pressure, and vacuum.

--- Stability: Duren are exceptionally stable on their feet. A duren receives a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying, riding or otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).

--- Structural Sense: This ability grants a duren a +2 cultural bonus on Search checks to notice unstable terrain, weakened structures, stress fractures, and faulty reinforcements. A duren who merely comes within 10 feet of unstable terrain or weakened structures can make a Search check as if he were actively searching.
