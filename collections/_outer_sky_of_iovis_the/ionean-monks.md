title: Ionean Monks
---

Monks on Ione are trained enforcers of what they claim are ancient laws passed down from the terraformers. They consider the laws non-negotiable constraints that cannot be rewritten, debated, or ignored. Most of them dictate where, when, and how people are allowed to settle near terraforming systems; these rules are passed down through monasteries where monks study and train, and they often act in a secondary role as law enforcers for the settlements they live in.

Example Monastery: _The Canticle Vault_, a maintenance cathedral built around a enormous mostly-buried "control choir" belonging to an atmospheric barrier machine they call Continuum Regulator Theta-9. The machine is known in common parlance as The Threnody Engine by the residents of Harthwake, the nearby settlement, from which the monastery recruits new disciples.
