Scent
-----

You can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. For upwind opponents, the range increases to 60 feet; if they are downwind, it drops to 15 feet. You can detect strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range.

When you detect a scent, you don’t determine its exact source—only its presence somewhere within range. You can take a standard action to note the direction of the scent. If you move within 5 feet of the source, you can pinpoint that source.

You can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom check to find or follow a track. Following a fresh trail is typically DC 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This Difficulty Class increases or decreases depending on the strength of the quarry’s odor, the number of creatures, and the trail’s age. For each hour that the trail has grown colder, the Difficulty Class increases by 2. Otherwise, follow the rules for the Track feat, but ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.
