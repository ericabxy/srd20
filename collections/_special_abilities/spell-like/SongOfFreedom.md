Song of Freedom
---------------

__Prerequisites:__ 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill, ability to cast arcane spells.

You can use music or poetics to create an effect equivalent to the *break enchantment* spell (caster level equals the character’s arcane spellcasting level). Using this ability requires 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration and music, and it functions on a single target within 30 feet. You can’t use *song of freedom* on yourself.
