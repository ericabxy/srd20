title: Vaelor Teth, Platform Custodian
---

Vaelor Teth is a half-giant who claims to understand the Old Platform when it behaves unpredictably. He speaks calmly and authoritatively even when others raise their voices. Some say the platform behaves differently when he's around. He is the current de facto mediator of platform usage, inheriting this position from its previous custodian.

Vaelor spends an hour every morning inspecting the Old Platform's known diagnostic panels, often closing his eyes to listen to its subtle noises and placing a hand on the structure to feel vibrations.

__♂ Vaelor Teth:__ 5th-level Adept; Medium-size humanoid (giant). HD 5d6 (17 hp); Init -1; Speed 30 ft.; AC 11 (touch 10, flat-footed 11); BAB +2; Special: Divine spells, powerful build. Abilities: Str 10, Dex 7, Con 10, Int 12, Wis 13, Cha 11.

_Skills and Feats:_ Knowledge (religion) +9, Knowledge (architecture) +9, Sense Motive +9, Concentration +8.

_Powerful Build:_ Whenever a half-giant is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the half-giant is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him.

A half-giant is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature’s special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A half-giant can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject’s size category.

_Typical Spells Prepared_ (3/3/2; save DC 11 + spell level): 0---*detect arcana, guidance, resistance;* 1st---*bless, command, sanctuary;* 2nd---*augury, calm emotions.*

_Spells Known:_ 0---*detect arcana, guidance, light, read magic, resistance;* 1st---*sanctuary, command, bless, detect chaos/law;* 2nd---*augury, calm emotions, hold person, knock, silence, spiritual weapon;* 3rd---*prayer, clairaudience/clairvoyance, divination, bestow curse, glyph of warding, speak with arcana.*

### Equipment and Assets

* Access to restricted sections of the Old Platform
* A small following of believers and assistants
* Records of the platform's behavior and past accidents

Vaelor wears a long-sleeved tunic and soft leggings bound with flat cords, and over that a knee-length robe tied with a sash. The sleeves roll back to allow his arms freedom of motion while working. The folds of the robe conceal several small pockets. Over his shoulders he wears a sleeveless mantle with a high collar. His boots are of soft leather and lace high on the calf.

He carries several items for testing the resonance, airflow, and electromagnetic fields emitted by the Old platfor, including a set of tuning rods and waxed cloth packets containing chalk powder. He also carries a smooth slate with a stylus he can use to take notes and write figures.

He also carries a small, heavy object that looks like it could be an electronic key. The previous custodian told him the platform responds to input differently when one is carrying this artifact.

### Possible Hooks

* Claims the platform is withholding access to certain functions
* Opposes attempts to resume platform use at full capacity

Design Notes
------------

Gamemakers should portray Vaelor Teth's spells as an enigmatic knowledge and procedures originating from his custodial and diagnostic relationship with the Old Platform, almost as if it was a deity granting divine spells. When his spells take effect, describe the platform responding, activating, opening doors, granting permission, etc. The Old Platform seems to recognize him as operator and intermediary.

Prepared spells are the result of hours spent listening, learning, practicing, and aligning himself with the Platform's "mood" and "authorization". Verbal components are formal phrases and access codes, ritualized chants that are half symbolic and half functional. Somatic components are deliberate gestures, placing a hand on an activation panel or fingers on keys, facing a biometric sensor, standing or sitting on particular spots or furniture. Material components are physical access keys and dataplates with enigmatic inscriptions.

Spells that alter reality cause the platform to behave differently than it would normally do, like doors opening automatically or lights activating without a visible switch. Mechanisms and displays may provide the answers called for by a spell.
