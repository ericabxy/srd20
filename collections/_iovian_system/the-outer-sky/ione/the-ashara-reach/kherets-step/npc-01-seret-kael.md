_Prosthetic Hand:_ Seret's prosthetic hand is leather-covered, five-fingered manipulator made of metal and ceramic parts. If she maintains the device as part of her daily "spell" preparation, with it she can pick up light objects (less than 5 pounds) and use them in a fully normal way. The hand is not powerful enough to wield weapons in combat, even if it can lift and carry the weapon.

If it is not maintained each day, she suffers a &minus;2 penalty to Climb, Craft, Open Lock, Sleight of Hand, and Use Magic Device checks. Removing the hand or neglecting it for more than two days increases this penalty to &minus;5.

Design Notes
------------

Gamemakers should portray Seret Kael's spellcasting as competence and preparedness. By quietly studying manuals and maintaining tools Seret becomes prepared to work apparent miracles of engineering. Frame the effect of her spells as natural consequences of experience, forethought, and preparation. Similar to Sherlock Holmes, she should be shown to have expertly understood something a spell reveals, or having cautiously prepared a solution that a spell caused.

Verbal components are muttered checklists, mantras, and procedures. Somatic components are practiced motions like adjusting a brace, tightening a strap, or tapping the housing of a machine before activating it. Material components are chalk marks, etched measurements, rivets, nails, shims, etc.
