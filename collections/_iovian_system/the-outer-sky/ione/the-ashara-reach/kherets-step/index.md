title: Kheret's Step
---

Kheret's Step is situated between two long ridges of broken stone, funneling crawlers and caravans into a shared corridor. The land slopes gently downward into a basin, creating a natural shelter against wind and dust. From a distance it is recognizable as a cluster of lights at night, and from the outlines of crawlers parked in uneven rows during the day.

Its a semi-permanent habitation centered around an ancient, half-buried structure used as a service and resupply platform. Temporary shelters, reinforced domes, cargo containers, and scavenged machine parts cluster together in rows along the side of the road. Above everything Iovis looms in the sky, its colorful bands shining upon the more reflective stone and metal surfaces.

* Crawlers approach from the west and north to repair and resupply, bartering for parts and labour
* Caravans arrive to water their animals and pitch camp
* The hub provides fuel, power, coolant, repair space and skilled manpower, food stockpiles, information and trading centers
* Home to permanent and transient residents

Crawlers and Caravans
---------------------

Surface crawlers are the backbone of long-distance travel across the Reach. They are large, slow vehicles propelled by four or six articulated treads that adjust to rough terrain. Crawlers stop at Kheret's Step to repair and resupply, queuing up in rows to wait for access to the Old Platform.

Caravans are an older mode of travel made up of dozens of traders, guides, and migrants. They are accompanied by pack animals, sleds, and carts; and can always be found camping within and around Kheret's Step in preparation for the next leg of a journey.

The Old Platform
----------------

At the heart of Kheret's Step stands an irregularly-shaped platform with recessed bays and vertical pylons. Its function is only partially understood; a forgotten technology pulsing with power conduits and pressurized chambers. Locals play custodian to the platform, interpreting its functions and marking sections as off-limits depending on perceived modes.
