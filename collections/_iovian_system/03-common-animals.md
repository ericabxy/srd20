Pack Animals and Beasts of Burden
---------------------------------

__Stonebacks__ are broad-bodied, six-limbed ungulates with thick, pebbled hides the color of basalt or clay. Their hooves are split and slightly flexible, allowing them to grip uneven stone without slipping. A low ridge of dense bone runs along their spine, used to anchor heavy packs or frame harnesses. Slow but relentless pace. Can go days on minimal water.

__Ashrunners__ are lean, long-legged bipeds with feathered crests and narrow, clawed feet. Their feathers trap ash and dust, helping regulate heat, while their tails act as counterweights on uneven slopes. They wear light harnesses rather than full packs. Excellent balance and high stamina, but skittish unless bonded to a handler. Used for fast travel and scouting.

Massive, low-slung amphibians with thick, leathery skin and wide feet. __Burden toads__ move slowly but can traverse mud, ash slurry, and shallow water without difficulty. Their bodies are naturally stable, allowing cargo to be lashed directly to their backs.

__Cliffhorns__ resemble compact, muscular goats with forward-curving horns and padded hooves. Their joints allow them to crouch low to the ground or spring short distances across gaps. Used for small-scale farming and transport along narrow trails and ridges. Sure-footed and stubborn. Grazes on sparse, mineral-rich plants.

__Glowbeasts__ are large, slow-moving quadrupeds with translucent skin that emits a faint light at night due to symbiotic bioluminescent organisms. Their glow intensifies under stress or exertion. Used as visual markers for convoys. Calm and placid but sensitive to environmental changes.
