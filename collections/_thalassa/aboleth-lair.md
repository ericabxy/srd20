Deep Trench -- Aboleth Lair
---------------------------

Up to three miles deep, near-freezing waters in a trench lined with bioluminescent algae. There is a series of underwater caverns near the trench bottom. An aboleth lairs here in the innermost cavern, partially hidden.

### Hazards

* Strong currents (DC 15 Swim check to avoid being swept into a tunnel).
* Aboleth will attempt to dominate one PC if encountered.
* Slime-coated tunnels are a slip hazard.

### Creatures

* 1 adult [aboleth](/MonstersIntro-A#aboleth)
* 2--4 "deepwater fish swarms" guarding the approach

### Rewards

* 1,500 gp (analogue)
* Rare bioluminescent materials (alchemy, crafting)
* Secret knowledge for underwater navigation

### Hooks

* The aboleth has been threatening a coastal settlement with psionic powers.
* Imprisoned or transformed friendly creatures have been taken hostage in the aboleth's lair.
