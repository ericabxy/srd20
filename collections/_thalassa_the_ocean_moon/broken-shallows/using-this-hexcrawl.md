## Using This Hexcrawl

Depending on the style of wilderness travel you want (long and slow or close and fast-paced), hexes are between 1 mile and 5 miles across. Only rafts and rowboats are small enough to navigate without running aground in the shallows; wading and swimming are options in some areas.
