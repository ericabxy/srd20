The High Rock Split (EL 3 to 5 transition)

Dark, jagged stone rises from the waters surrounding the central rock-island. These spaces (#) on the map can be entered, but rocky terrain and sheer cliffs prevent crossing them to dry land. The only movement possible is from one rock space to another or back to a shallows (=) space.

TODO: Strong currents and shadowed channels. Navigable but unsafe. Ambush predators, creatures adapted to the geology, smugglers, hidden lairs.

Black Spine Channel (C5): Jagged rock and fast currents. Profession (sailor) checks needed to safely move watercraft through, or Knowledge (geography) to go on foot or swimming. (TODO: signs of smugglers passing through?)

Splitfin Pass (D4):

The Stone Teeth (E4): Impassable rock spines. Can move through but not across to inland. EL &mdash;.
