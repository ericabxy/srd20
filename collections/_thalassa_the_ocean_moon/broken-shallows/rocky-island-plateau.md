title: Rocky Island Plateau
---

Central Island Plateau (EL 3 to 4 at surface, 2 to 3 in shallows)

Plateau/valley ^ surrounded by steep rock #. From outside looks like a raised rocky island with cliffs. At the top it is wind-scoured stone with wet scrub jungle and ancient ruins/landmark.

This is the exploration hook or lure. Land-based predators, territorial creatures, and ruins hinting at older settlements and civilizations. May be more dangerous here than the water around the shoals.

The Wind-cut Plateau (D5): Raised, rocky island with scrub. Ruins and markers from a previous age. EL 3&ndash;4 on land, EL 2 in the water; predators are territorial and bold.

Cliffside Pools (E5): Freshwater pools next to rocky cliffs. EL 3 opportunity predators and prey.
