Traits
------

--- Humanoid (human): Waterborn are humanoid creatures with the human subtype.

--- Medium-size: No special bonuses or penalties due to size.

--- Base land speed is 30 ft.

--- Aquatic Subtype: A waterborn has a swim speed and thus can move in water without making Swim checks. An aquatic creature can breathe underwater. It cannot also breathe air unless it has the amphibious special quality (which waterborn do). 

--- Low-light vision: A waterborn can see four times as far as normal in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. It retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

__Swim Speed:__ 30 feet. A waterborn can move through water at its swim speed without making Swim checks. It has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

__Amphibious:__ Waterborn can breathe both air and water.
