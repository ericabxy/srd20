Organic Resource Economy
------------------------

Thalassa has a water-dominant geology with a scarcity of dry land and metal deposits, but is rich in biological resources. Organic "loot" serves as a resource for building and repairing tools and structures. Some items have a cultural value and some represent survival knowledge. (Think boats lashed together with sinew, armor grown and stitched from thick or hardened hides, etc.. look to _The Saga of Ryzom_ and _Kingdom Death: Monster_ for outside examples.

### Resources

> Resources worth X gp.

"Resources" represent valuable organic, mineral, or alien materials harvested from creatures, environments, or abandoned sites. These are assumed to be tradeable, preservable, or refinable by coastal settlements, caravans, or specialist buyers.

Examples: Hardened plates of chitin, preserved organs or glands, alchemical oils/resins, bioluminescent tissue, dense bone/cartilage/shell, crystalline growths, mineral nodules.

> “The remains yield valuable chitin, oils, and preserved organs worth approximately 1,800 gp to the right buyers.”

### Goods

> Valuable goods including X gems or art objects (total value Y gp).

Goods are discrete, high-value items that are unusual, refined, or culturally significant. On Europa, these are often biological or technological curios rather than precious stones or sculpture.

Examples: encrusted bioluminescent tissue, preserved organisms, worked ornaments of shell/coral/chitin, tools of unknown origin

### Items

### Structural Materials

Replaces or supplements meager wood and metal supplies.

* Chitin Plates (from crabs, chuul, kraken)
* Cartilage (from large fish and leviathans)
* Coral and bone (large fish, reefs, some materials extraordinarily hard)
* Crystal or salt-glass shells (deep sea creatures in mineral-saturated waters)
* Tendon cords (harvested from creatures with extraordinarily strong ligaments)

### Functional Organs

Some of these stand in for magic items.

* Bladders (ballast, breathing aids)
* Light- and electro-sensory organs/receptors (navigation, detection, communication)
* Bioluminescent organs/glands (light, signaling, rituals)
* Venom glands/sacs (toxins, solvents, medicine)
* Neural and psionic tissue (rare, visions, lore, magic powers)

### Consumables and Catalysts

Temporary resources that partially replace the default coin economy. Since these items decay, spoil, lose potency, sometimes even mutate, and are often irretrievably consumed; trade is driven by urgency, location (how far away the resource is, which community has the skill to use it), and obligation (reciprocation, distribution).

* Oils and fats (fuel, light, waterproofing, medicine)
* Salts and crystals (preservation, alchemy, ritual)
* Enzymes and slurries (fermentation, corrosion, medicine)
* Spores and eggs (food, farm seeding)
* Inks and fluids (writing, drawing, tattooing, glyphs)

Examples of Material Sources
----------------------------

Giant Crabs: chitinous plating for shields, armor, hull plating; claws for stoneworking tools; meat and salt for preservation

Merrow and Locathah: traded with for crafted tools, bargained with for access to fishing zones, reefs, breeding grouds. In extreme or taboo cases killed and harvested for muscle fibers, lungs, bladders.

Aboleth: rare resources from a powerful psionic predator; mind-altering substances; neural filaments for psionic or neurolectrical conduction; very dangerous to harvest, to the harvester and possibly nearby civilizations due to retaliation.

_The Hunt_ as an Economic Ritual/Event
--------------------------------------

Communities regularly train and deploy hunters to venture out and retrieve resources. Cultures and memory revolve around planning and remembering this dangerous and necessary activity, as well as preserving the knowledge of each resources multiple uses and how to make/keep them usable. Dangers and failures include spoilage, contamination, attracting predators/scavengers, and even intercultural retaliation.

Treasure Hordes
---------------

| Status of Lair                     | Fraction of Listed Treasure
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------
| Ancient tyrant / established ruler | 100%
| Settled, but cautious              | 50%
| Recent or transient lair           | 25%-35%
| Driven off early or flees          | 10%-15%

Resource Equivalents
--------------------

### "Coins" Column

Practically fungible harvest materials. Adventurers will bring preservatives and containers to harvest and transport these materials from an expedition.

1. CP: Bulk Stock, Yield, Drift
2. SP: Trade Stock, Refined Yield, Current
3. GP: Strategic Stock, Critical Yield, Pressure
4. PP: Legacy Stock, Prime Yield, Abyssal

#### Tier I (cp): Common Extracts

Low-grade, bulky, widely available. Value represents the effort of harvesting, preserving, and transporting these materials. Keeps people alive and structures in good repair.

- Nutrient slurries, protein gels, algael cakes.
- Raw salts, brines, mineral sands.
- Fibrous kelp, chitin flakes, shell fragments.
- Crude hydrocarbons or biological oils.
- Untreated construction-grade coral or bone.

Optional: Many of these items are _perishable_ and should be "spent" quickly.

#### Tier II (sp): Refined Materials

Processed, stabilized, or specially harvested. Value represents the expertise needed to produce and preserve these materials.

- Refined biological/organic minerals.
- Medicinal compounds, antiseptics, stimulants.
- Conductive salts, piezoelectric organics.
- Engine-grade fuels or power gels.
- Durable synthetics grown organically.

Optional: Some of these items _destabilize_ over time, losing their value.

#### Tier III (gp): Rare Biotics

- Rare symbiotic organisms.
- High-pressure deep-sea harvest yields.
- Memory- or data-storing crystals or living substrates.
- Industrial-grade bio-materials and minerals.
- Longevity serums and adaptive gene cultures.

Optional: Some of these materials _grow_ or _mutate_, making them unreliable if not spent immediately.

#### Tier IV (pp): One-of-a-kind or Legacy Assets

Irreplaceable, ancient, or systemically valuable. This level of materials can change futures, rewrite the past, and even provoke wars.

- Endangered or extinct strains of organisms.
- Pre-historical artifacts or samples.
- Planetary-scale catalysts or control materials.
- Self-replicating industrial-grade organisms.
- Cultural relics tied to early history or pre-history.

Optional: Many of these materials are likely to attract attention, making it paramount to fence them soon after obtaining them.
