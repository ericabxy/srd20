Sneak Attack
------------

If you can catch an opponent when it is unable to defend itself effectively from your attack, you can strike a vital spot for extra damage.

Your attack deals extra damage any time your target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when you flanks your target. This extra damage starts at 1d6 and increases by 1d6 every time you take a new sneak attack feat. Should you score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.

Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.

With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, you can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. You cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual –4 penalty.

You can sneak attack only living creatures with discernible anatomies—undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. You must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. You cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.

Notes
-----

Sneak attack is a combat ability but classes tend to gain its benefits regardless of being especially stealthy or dexterous. Its being gated behind base attack bonus to represent this nature. Any character can gain it at first level, but improving it depends on how their attack bonus progresses. A rogue-like character with a little combat focus can gain it every two levels. A wizard-like character with only a basic (poor) base attack bonus would struggle to gain sneak attack as few as seven times in twenty levels.
