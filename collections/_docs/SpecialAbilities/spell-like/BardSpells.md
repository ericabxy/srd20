Bard Spells
-----------

You can cast arcane spells, which are drawn from the bard spell list. You can cast any spell you know without preparing it ahead of time. Every bard spell has a verbal component (singing, reciting, or music). To learn or cast a spell, you must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a bard’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bard’s Charisma modifier.

Like other spellcasters, you can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Bard. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a high Charisma score. When Table: Bard Spells Known indicates that the bard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, you gain only the bonus spells you would be entitled to based on your Charisma score for that spell level.

The bard’s selection of spells is extremely limited. You start off knowing four 0-level spells of your choice. Each time you take this feat again, you gain one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Bard Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells you know is not affected by your Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Bard Spells Known are fixed.)

The 5th time you take this feat, and every third time after that (8th, 11th, and so on), you can choose to learn a new spell in place of one you already know. In effect, you “lose” the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level bard spell you can cast. You may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that you gain new spells known for the level.

As noted above, you need not prepare your spells in advance. You can cast any spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level.
