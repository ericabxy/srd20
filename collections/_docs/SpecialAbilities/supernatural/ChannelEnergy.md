Channel Energy
--------------

Positive and negative energy can be channeled to assert authority over creatures sustained by ongoing external effects; such as undead creatures, summoned creatures, creatures under possession, and temporarily animated constructs.

Positive energy has the power to suppress and dismiss such beings, while negative energy has the power to coerce or sustain them.

### Summoned Creatures

Channeling may affect any creature that is summoned using _summon monster, summon nature's ally,_ and so on. Turning drives such creatures away, rebuking can suppress or command them, and destruction has the same effect as dismissal.

### Animated Objects

Channeling may affect creatures who's animation is directly sustained by a spell or magical effect, such as _animate objects_. This does NOT include golems, warforged, or other permanently enchanted autonomous constructs.

### Possessed Creatures

Channeling may target creatures currently affected by a possession effect described as "possession" by a spell or supernatural ability. This does not include mind control, _charm_, or _dominate._

Turning suppresses or ends (destroys) the possession effect. Rebuking may hold such creatures in place or force submission.

### Undead Creatures

Channeling has power over the negative energy that sustains undead creatures. A turning attempt may target creatures with the "undead" type, with positive energy turning them and negative energy rebuking them.

Does Nots
---------

Channeling energy does not dispel positive status effects, suppress magic items, end curses or compulsions, shut down persistent spell effects, affect permanent constructs, or affect non-creature magical effects (such as walls, zones, illusions, etc.).

Design Notes
------------

Channelers can revoke or overwrite the authority of external processes controlling or animating a creature.

Channel energy affects creatures whose continued presence or state depends on an active metaphysical authorization. Native, self-sustaining creatures and purely abstract magical effects are unaffected.
