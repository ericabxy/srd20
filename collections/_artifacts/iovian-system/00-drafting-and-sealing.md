title: Drafting and Sealing Documents for this project
---

Lifecycle
---------

Documents are created and exist in three states.

### 1. Draft

* open to expansion
* structural experimentation allowed

### 2. Finished

* Internal logic is stable
* Scope is deliberate
* Can support other artifacts

### 3. Sealed

* No new material
* Corrections of typos and for clarity allowed
* Changes require a new artifact (keep this one intact)

Sealing Criteria
----------------

Define a checklist for each document where once all the items are true, the document is sealed even if the prose or presentation could be prettier. Don't wait to finish full NPC rosters, maps, or full backstory. Use a spreadsheet to track sealed documents.

Example for regions:

- Clear physical character (terrain, travel, hazards)
- Socioeconomic mode implied
- At least two reasons to travel through this region
- At least one reason to stay
- Naturally suggests 1-2 hubs

Example for hubs:

- Daily life is describable in one paragraph
- One conflict/situation exists to anchor play
- Clearly structured authority
- Non-named NPC roles are implied

Addends and Versioning
----------------------

If modifications or additions are needed for sealed documents, write a separate "addendum" or revision.
