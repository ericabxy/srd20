Iovian System Overview
======================

Iovis is a colossal gas giant in the outer Solar System. Its surface is a roiling sea of storms and colorful jet streams. Its gravitational field has captured over a hundred moons, moonlets, and asteroids which have been settled over the millennia by the Solar System's inhabitants.

The Outer Sky of Iovis
----------------------

The Outer Sky is an orbital region in the inner Iovian system. The moon Ione and its lesser cousins orbit close to the thin inner rings of the planet along with dozens of space stations, debris, asteroid mines, and space transports.
