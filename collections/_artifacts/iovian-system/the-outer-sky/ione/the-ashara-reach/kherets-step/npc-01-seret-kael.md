Design Notes
------------

Gamemakers should portray Seret Kael's spellcasting as competence and preparedness. By quietly studying manuals and maintaining tools Seret becomes prepared to work apparent miracles of engineering. Frame the effect of her spells as natural consequences of experience, forethought, and preparation. Similar to Sherlock Holmes, she should be shown to have expertly understood something a spell reveals, or having cautiously prepared a solution that a spell caused.

Verbal components are muttered checklists, mantras, and procedures. Somatic components are practiced motions like adjusting a brace, tightening a strap, or tapping the housing of a machine before activating it. Material components are chalk marks, etched measurements, rivets, nails, shims, etc.
