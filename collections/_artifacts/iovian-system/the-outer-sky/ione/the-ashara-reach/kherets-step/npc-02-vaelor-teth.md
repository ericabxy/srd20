Vaelor Teth, Platform Custodian
===============================

Vaelor Teth claims to understand the Old Platform when it behaves unpredictably. He speaks calmly and authoritatively even when others raise their voices. Some say the platform behaves differently when he's around. He is the current de facto mediator of platform usage inherited from its previous custodian.

Vaelor spends an hour every morning inspecting the Old Platform's known diagnostic panels, often closing his eyes to listen to its subtle noises and placing a hand on the structure to feel vibrations.

### Equipment and Assets

* Access to restricted sections of the Old Platform
* A small following of believers and assistants
* Records of the platform's behavior and past accidents

Vaelor wears a long-sleeved tunic and soft leggings bound with flat cords, and over that a knee-length robe tied with a sash. The sleeves roll back to allow his arms freedom of motion while working. The folds of the robe conceal several small pockets. Over his shoulders he wears a sleeveless mantle with a high collar. His boots are of soft leather and lace high on the calf.

He carries several items for testing the resonance, airflow, and electromagnetic fields emitted by the Old platfor, including a set of tuning rods and waxed cloth packets containing chalk powder. He also carries a smooth slate with a stylus he can use to take notes and write figures.

He also carries a small, heavy object that looks like it could be an electronic key. The previous custodian told him the platform responds to input differently when one is carrying this artifact.

### Hooks

* Claims the platform is withholding access to certain functions
* Opposes attempts to resume platform use at full capacity

Design Notes
------------

Gamemakers should portray Vaelor Teth's magic as though they are enigmatic knowledge and procedures originating from his custodial and diagnostic relationship with the Old Platform, almost as if it was a deity granting divine spells. When his spells take effect, describe the platform responding, activating, opening doors, granting permission, etc. The Old Platform seems to recognize him as operator and intermediary.

Prepared spells are the result of hours spent listening, learning, practicing, and aligning himself with the Platform's "mood" and "authorization". Verbal components are formal phrases and access codes, ritualized chants that are half symbolic and half functional. Somatic components are deliberate gestures, placing a hand on an activation panel or fingers on keys, facing a biometric sensor, standing or sitting on particular spots or furniture. Material components are physical access keys and dataplates with enigmatic inscriptions.

Spells that alter reality cause the platform to behave differently than it would normally do, like doors opening automatically or lights activating without a visible switch. Mechanisms and displays may provide the answers called for by a spell.
