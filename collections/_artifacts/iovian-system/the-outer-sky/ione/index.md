title: Ione, Moon of Iovis
---

Ione is the fifth satellite of Iovis and the first to possess adequate gravity and atmosphere. It has a yellowish surface marked with volcanoes and fault lines. Geothermal vents provide warmth on its otherwise frigid surface. Water streams from mysterious aquifers and pools in shallow seas. The moon is home to thousands of people and myriad cultures. The thin atmosphere grants a clear view of Iovis slowly rotating overhead.

The moon is a young world on the cosmic scale. Long ago it was much more volcanically active, but those processes have settled to an intermediate stage where ashfall serves as a sort of proto-soil and waters cycle through underground caverns and surface seas. Mediating it all is what can only be described as an ancient terraforming process started by unknown benefactors. Huge enigmatic machines process and stabilize the thin atmosphere, convert geothermal heat into usable energy, and produce useful minerals and gasses.
