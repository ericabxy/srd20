title: The Outer Sky of Iovis
---

Iovis dominates the view of every inhabitant in the Outer Sky. It is a colossus of layered clouds, banded with colors and marred by slow, grinding storms older than some civilizations. Its innermost rings a dark bands of dust faintly visible and spread out along the plane of the giant's rotation.

Natural and artificial bodies orbit the giant like a solemn procession; moons and asteroids, active and abandoned space stations, debris fields and objects on decaying orbits, and structures whose original purpose has been forgotten. It is home to everyone from settlers and traders to cultists and archivists. To travel through the Outer Sky is to move through bands of influence as varied as the surface of Iovis and as real as its gravitational pull.

Ione is the largest moon this close to Iovis. It is a world settled by myriad cultures in regions clustered around its most habitable zones. From its surface Iovis appears to fill a third of the heavens. Many of its inhabitants observe and map the gas giant above, while others interpret its signs as the passing of ages and the telling of omens.

The Outer Sky is a collection of places to be and places to go, yet distances are vast and travel measured in days and weeks. Communication lags, news travels slow, and people appear and disappear by accident and design. To live here is to be constantly aware of your own smallness, the immensity of the sky, and the intangible threads connecting people and places.
