Kheret's Step
=============

Kheret's Step is situated between two long ridges of broken stone, funneling crawlers and caravans into a shared corridor. The land slopes gently downward into a basin, creating a natural shelter against wind and dust. From a distance it is recognizable as a cluster of lights at night, and from the outlines of crawlers parked in uneven rows during the day.

Its a semi-permanent habitation centered around an ancient, half-buried structure used as a service and resupply platform. Temporary shelters, reinforced domes, cargo containers, and scavenged machine parts cluster together in rows along the side of the road. Above everything Iovis looms in the sky, its colorful bands shining upon the more reflective stone and metal surfaces.

* Crawlers approach from the west and north to repair and resupply, bartering for parts and labour
* Caravans arrive to water their animals and pitch camp
* The hub provides fuel, power, coolant, repair space and skilled manpower, food stockpiles, information and trading centers
* Home to permanent and transient residents

The Old Platform
----------------

At the heart of Kheret's Step stands a circular platform with recessed bays and vertical pylons. Its function is only partially understood; a forgotten technology pulsing with power conduits and pressurized chambers. Locals play custodian to the platform, interpreting its functions and marking sections as off-limits depending on perceived modes.

The People
----------

* Operators with malfunctioning or aging crawlers
* Free traders avoiding centralized authority
* Pilgrims and scholars who study the Reach or Iovis
* Refugees fleeing ecological or economic collapse
* Influence belongs to those who control water access, repair crews, route knowledge, security

Possible Hooks
