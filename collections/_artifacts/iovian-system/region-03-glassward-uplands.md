Glassward Uplands
=================

The uplands rise gently into broad plateaus of volcanic stone. The ground sparkles faintly under Iovis' light, a consequence of silica-rich soil. Ecology is sparse but resilient, consisting of crystal-stemmed plants, hardy grasses, and burrowing animals.

The plateaus serve as natural crossroads as travelers prefer to cross through the stable, predictable terrain despite the altitude and edibles. Upon the flat terrain is dotted waystations, signal towers, and windmills. Iovis feels closer and larger in the sky.

Hooks
-----

- Caravan politics and escort missions
- Conflicts over routes and infrastructure
- maybe put schools, government buildings, and cultist temples here
