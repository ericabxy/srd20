The gas giant Iovis sits in the outer Solar System, its turbulent surface looming enormous and ever-present in the heavens. Its colorful storms and eddies are the subject of scientific study and divine interpretation. Its faint, shimmering rings and vast magnetosphere are inhabited by countless satellites, forgotten debris, commercial centers, waystations, and cult-sites.

The moon Ione orbits close above the innermost ring, a habitable world with broad canal-seas and crustal highlands. Several alien cultures call the moon home, inhabiting its bustling city-states, vast wildernesses, and ancient ruins.

## Surface Realms

Ione Proper.

Dozens of seaside cities, fortress citadels, and nomadic tribes live in close proximity near the equator in the primary hemisphere.

## Orbital Holdings

Ring-stations and cylinders built from various materials and scavenged debris orbit Iovis along with the moon, serving as trade hubs, habitats, and outposts for Ione.

## Other Moons and Satellites

Other minor moons and major stations orbit far from Ione's social-economic zone, hiding religious enclaves, observation posts, and abandoned spheres.
