title: The Platform Restricts Access
---

Three crawler failures have occurred within a short time window. Power fluctuations in the Old Platform have disrupted operations and delayed repairs and resupply. Several caravans and convoys traveling south have not been heard from or been forced to turn back after departing. Vaelor Teth and his followers have begun restricting access to the platform exacerbating the delays.

Seret and Vaelor
----------------

Seret Kael wants to resume normal repairs and end the traffic delays before trade routes are disrupted beyond control. Vaelor Teth insists the platform is responding to recent strain and misuse, and cannot be forced to comply.

Quests
------

* Investigate crawler failures
* Mediate an argument between Seret and Vaelor
* Escort search parties to find the missing convoys

The Long Wake
-------------

A crawler named The Long Wake is presently grounded near the Old Platform, its forward-left tread-leg seized after a stress redistribution failure. Repairs are possible but require parts not currently available in the camp.

Its presence has caused congestion:

- Other crawlers queue awkwardly around it
- Caravans cluster nearby for protection

Outcomes
--------

* Traffic Resumes and repairs proceed aggressively
  * The Long Wake is restored and leaves south
  * Minor accidents occur at the Old Platform in the coming weeks
* Access remains restricted
  * Convoys turn back, forge ahead without repairs, or abandon cargo
  * Several caravans decide to settle the Step permanently
