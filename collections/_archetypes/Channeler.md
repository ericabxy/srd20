Channeler
---------

__Hit Die:__ d8.

__Good Saving Throws:__ Fortitude and Will.

__Base Attack Bonus:__ Average.

__Spells:__ A channeler casts divine spells, which are drawn from the [cleric spell list](/SpellListI#cleric-spells) or the [druid spell list](/SpellListII#druid-spells). A channeler must choose and prepare their spells in advance just like a [druid](/ClassesI#druid) or [cleric](/ClassesI#cleric).

To prepare or cast a spell, a channeler must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a channeler’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the channeler’s Wisdom modifier. A channeler can prepare and cast three 0-level spells (Orisons) per day, and one 1st-level spell per day plus any bonus spells from a high Wisdom score.

__Channel Energy:__ A channeler who casts cleric spells has the power to [channel positive or negative energy](/ChannelEnergy), chosen upon gaining their first level in the class. The energy is channeled into a turning attempt, which can affect certain creatures as in [turn or rebuke undead](/CombatII#turn-or-rebuke-undead). A channeler may attempt to channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + their Charisma modifier.

__Primal Energy:__ A channeler who casts druid spells has the power to attune with nature; granting her a primal bond, a primal shape, primal rage, or primal mastery, chosen upon gaining their first level in the class.

_Primal Bond:_ A primal bond channeler can begin play with an [animal companion](/AnimalCompanion).

_Primal Shape:_ A primal shape channeler gains [wild shape](/WildShape) at 5th level.

_Primal Rage:_ A primal rage channeler gains [fast movement](/FastMovement) and can fly into a [rage](/Rage) once per day.

_Primal Mastery:_ A primal mastery channeler gains a bonus to AC and a [favored enemy](/FavoredEnemy).

__Spontaneous Casting:__ A positive-energy channeler can "lose" any prepared spell that is not a domain spell in order to cast a _cure_ spell of the same spell level or lower (a _cure_ spell is any spell with "cure" in its name). A negative-energy channeler can’t convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to _inflict_ spells (an _inflict_ spell is one with “inflict” in its name). A primal-energy channeler can only convert prepared spells to _summon nature's ally_ spells.
