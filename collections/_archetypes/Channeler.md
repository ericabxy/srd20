Channeler
---------

__Hit Die:__ d8.

__Good Saving Throws:__ Fortitude and Will.

__Base Attack Bonus:__ Average.

__Spells:__ A channeler casts divine spells, which are drawn from the [cleric spell list](/SpellListI#cleric-spells). A channeler must choose and prepare their spells in advance (see below).

To prepare or cast a spell, a channeler must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a channeler’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the channeler’s Wisdom modifier.

A channeler can prepare and cast three 0-level spells (Orisons) per day, and one 1st-level spell per day plus any bonus spells from a high Wisdom score.

_Improved Spellcasting:_ At 2nd level the channeler can cast two more spells per day at the two highest levels they can already cast (four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells). This increase repeats every two levels after 2nd (4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level).

_Higher Spellcasting:_ At 3rd level a channeler can cast one spell per day at a new spell level (one 2nd-level spell). This increase repeats every two levels after 3rd. At 7th level and every two levels thereafter they can also cast one more spell per day at the lowest level they can already cast that isn't already at 4/day.

__Channel Energy:__ A channeler has the power to channel positive or negative energy, chosen upon gaining their first level in this class. A channeled energy attempt can be used for a variety of effects. A channeler may attempt to channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + their Charisma modifier.

_Turn Creature (Su):_ Channeled energy has the power to affect undead creatures, summoned creatures, extraplanar creatures, constructs animated by magic, and creatures with an alignment subtype. Creatures with the native subtype are unaffected unless otherwise specified.

- Any creature with the undead type.
- Any creature summoned by a spell or spell-like ability such as _summon nature's ally_, _summon monster_, or _summon_.
- Any creature with the construct type if animated by magic.
- Any creature with an alignment subtype (good, evil, lawful, chaotic).

See [Turn or Rebuke Undead](/CombatII#turn-or-rebuke-undead) for how to make a turning attempt against such creatures, treating channeler level as cleric level.

All affected creatures are turned by positive energy or rebuked by negative energy. Only undead creatures can be destroyed or commanded. Negative energy can dispel turning or bolster creatures against turning attempts.

A channeler may attempt to turn creatures a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. A channeler with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) gets a +2 bonus on turning checks against undead.

__Spontaneous Casting:__ A positive-energy channeler can "lose" any prepared spell that is not a domain spell in order to cast a cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with "cure" in its name).

A negative-energy channeler can’t convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict spells (an inflict spell is one with “inflict” in its name).
