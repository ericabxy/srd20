title: Chassis
---

The chassis system is designed to build traditional and variant SRD characters from basic principles, eliminating the need for hybrid classes and discouraging multi-classing. The system allows for a lot more customization, limited mixing and matching of common class features, all while preserving the strong identity a class would normally get.
