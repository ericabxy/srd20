The talent trees of <abbr title="Modern System Reference Document">MSRD</abbr> are versatile and inspired by <abbr title="System Reference Document">SRD</abbr> core classes. They are reproduced here converted to feat format for convenience. All references to "action points" are changed to uses per day. References to MSRD skills or feats are struck out or converted to SRD.

__Score-based Special Ability System__: Your class may restrict which special abilities you can choose e.g. by saying "choose any Wisdom or Charisma special ability from this list" or "you must have a Constitution score of at least 11 to choose the corresponding special ability". You must still meet all listed prerequisites to gain the ability.

Alternatively the class feature may simply say "choose any special ability from this list" in which case you need only abide by the prerequisite(s) listed for that special ability.

__Class Level__: For the purposes of the following descriptions, "class level" refers to the class in which you gained the special ability. Multiclass characters have fewer class levels than total character levels for the purposes of the following descriptions.

__Revisions__: Athough based on MSRD, this abilities list is part of a flexible class system and subject to change for balance and flavor purposes.
