Blue
----

Also known by the misnomer "Rigelian Blue", these creatures were once thought to hail from a star system in the direction of Rigel. In reality they've inhabited our solar system since the dawn of intelligent life, and large clusters of nomadic blues began migrating back from a centuries-long jaunt to the Oort cloud in recent decades.

Blues are small, primate-like humanoids with bat-like faces and fine coats of fur. The Oort segment of the population used to sport primarily gray and silver fur before reintegrating into the greater gene pool, and now come in a variety of colors. Blues are excellent climbers and their buildings and craft reflect this aptitude by featuring high hides, handholds, ladders, and ropes.

Blues favor the barbarian and rogue classes.

### Blue Traits

Blue characters possess the following racial traits.

* −2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, −2 Charisma.
* Blue base land speed is 30 feet.
* A blue has a climb speed of 20 feet. Blues are natural climbers, able to scramble up trees with ease. See [Climb Speed](#climb-speed) for details.
* __Goblinoid:__ Blues are humanoids with the goblinoid subtype.
* __Small:__ As a Small creature, a blue gains a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks, but she uses smaller weapons than humans use, and her lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.
* __Low-Light Vision:__ A blue can see twice as far as normal in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
* +4 racial bonus on Jump checks: Blues are accomplished leapers.

#### Climb Speed

As a creature with a climb speed, blues have a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. It must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC of more than 0, but it always can choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened while climbing. If it chooses an accelerated climb, it moves at double its climb speed and makes a single Climb check at a -5 penalty. It cannot run while climbing. It retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus on their attacks against a climbing blue. Also, blues add their Dexterity modifier to Climb checks instead of their Strength modifier.

Experimental
------------

__Channeling:__ Blue spellcasters gain bonus spells as if the governing ability score were 1 point higher. This benefit does not grant them the ability to cast spells unless they gain that ability through levels in a spellcaster class.
