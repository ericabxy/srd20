Low-slung pack hunters with reinforced jaws and sensory bristles along their flanks. They are natural predators who cull weak prey from grazing herds. Lone lurkers hunt by ambush near migratory paths, while multiple lurkers hunt in packs.

#### Combat

A favorite tactic for a lurker pack is to send a few individuals against the foe’s front while the rest of the pack circles and attacks from the flanks or rear.

__Trip (Ex):__ A lurker that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+1 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the lurker.

__Skills:__ *Lurkers have a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent.
