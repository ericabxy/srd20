A creature with an insect-like carapace that accumulates dust in intricate visible patterns. Trained dustmotes are used as familiars. They react to environmental changes and are frequently seen grooming themselves.

#### Combat

Dustmotes usually run away. They bite only as a last resort. They are exceptional climbers and swimmers.

__Skills:__ Dustmotes have a +4 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks, and a +8 racial bonus on Balance, Climb, and Swim checks. A dustmote can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened. A rat uses its Dexterity modifier instead of its Strength modifier for Climb and Swim checks. A dustmote has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
