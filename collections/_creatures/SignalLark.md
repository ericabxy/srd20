A small bird with a throat sac that resonates with certain frequencies and energy fields. The signal lark is capable of mimicking some of the sounds it hears, but imperfectly. They are about 2 feet long with glossy black hides and wingspans of about 4 feet. They use hooked talons to strike and capture prey. The statistics presented here can describe most nonpredatory birds of similar size.

Tamed signal larks are used as familiars and messengers. They tend to react when machinery activates nearby, likely sensing the electromagnetic fields of electrified cables.
