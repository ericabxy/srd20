Shardback Grazer
----------------

A six-limbed, thick-bodied herbivore with overlapping plates of hide and a low, wedge-shaped head. Used primarily as mounts and pack animals. Their hooves are split and slightly flexible, allowing them to grip uneven stone without slipping. In the wild they run in herds and migrate along mineral-rich corridors grazing on silica plants.

#### Combat

Its hoof attack is treated as a secondary attack and adds only half the creatures’s Strength bonus to damage. (These secondary attacks are noted with an asterisk in the Attack and Full Attack entries for the heavy and the light variety.)
