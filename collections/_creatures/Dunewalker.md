Tall, long-necked quadrupeds with segmented legs and internal water sacs. Their skin folds act as heat dissipators. Striders are known for their ability to travel long distances without food or water. Used for long-distance travel and transport.

An average strider stands about 7 feet tall at the shoulder. There is a stockier variety that is slower (speed 40 feet), and has a higher Constitution score (16).

__Carrying Capacity:__ A light load for a strider is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301–600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601–900 pounds. A strider can drag 4,500 pounds.
