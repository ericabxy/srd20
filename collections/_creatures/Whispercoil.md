A long, flexible reptile with segmented scales. It can sense body heat through specialized organs in its snout. These creatures range widely in size, the stats above being for the smallest variety used as familiars by wizards and adepts. They are not particularly aggressive, but will often lash out with a bite attack before attempting to retreat. In the wild they are found living in machine ruins and warm stone outcroppings. Their regular movements are slow, punctuated by sudden motion when attacking.

#### Combat

Whispercoils rely on their venomous bite to kill prey and defend themselves.

__Poison (Ex):__ A whispercoil has a poisonous bite that deals initial and secondary damage of 1d6 Con. The save DC varies by the snake’s size, as shown on the table below. The save DCs are Constitution-based.
