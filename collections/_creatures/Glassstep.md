Lean, digitigrade predators with tranlucent footpads that distribute their weight on loose and rocky terrain. Their eyes reflect light like polished crystal. Trained runners are used as guards, trackers, and sometimes pack and riding animals.

They are known for their loyalty and territoriality as tamed animals and hunting small prey across broken ground and sand flats in the wild.

__Carrying Capacity:__ A light load for a runner is up to 100 pounds; a medium load, 101–200 pounds; and a heavy load, 201–300 pounds. A runner can drag 1,500 pounds.

Combat
------

If trained for war, these animals can make trip attacks.

__Trip (Ex):__ A runner that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+1 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the wolf.

__Skills:__ Runners have a +4 racial bonus on Jump checks. *Runners have a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent.
