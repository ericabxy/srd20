Special Abilities
=================

The rogue's special ability class feature can be modified to allow for generic characters.

- Camouflage (Ex): As ranger. Prerequisites: Hide 11 ranks, Survival 11 ranks.
- Evasion (Ex): As monk. Prerequisite: Base Reflex save +3.
- Improved Attack Bonus: Add a +1 proficiency bonus to your base attack bonus. Can be repeatedly taken two levels after the last time it was gained. Bonus stacks and counts as your natural base attack bonus for all purposes.
- Improved Evasion (Ex): As monk. Prerequisite: Base Reflex save +6.

### Progression

Special abilities that improve several times often follow a pattern of progression. Similar to prestige classes, the generic system doesn't have prerequisites tied to character or class level. Progression can be limited by base attack and save bonuses or skill ranks, which can effectively gate progression. Sometimes, it may be appropriate to stipulate a "gap" required between the last time an ability improved and gaining it again.

Progression can also be limited to a character's natural progression. For example, an ability can only be gained or improved once per ability score increase (levels 1-3, 4-7, 8-11, 12-15, 16-19, and 20).

### Spellcasting

Clerics, druids, sorcerers, and wizards follow an accelerated progression of spell knowledge and spell-casting ability. Bards, paladins, and rangers learn spells later or at a slower rate. Prestige classes introduce the idea of progressing the spell-casting ability of another class--at the same or a slowed rate--while gaining different class features.

Magic users tend to trade class features in favor of an arsenal of spells to cast, or learn spells slower while gaining a myriad of other class features. This is how a generic character can learn magic; at each level, depending on your background, you can choose to enhance your ability to cast spells at the expense of other interesting special abilities.

How It Works
------------

For the most straightforward example, recreate the fighter class using special abilities. A poor base attack bonus needs only to gain a permanent base attack bonus increase every odd-numbered level. Then every even-numbered level can be used to take the bonus feat a normal fighter gains at those levels. Finally, it needs an additional bonus feat at 1st level to round out the feature list in addition to a "good" fortitude saving throw.

A generic class needs at least two special abilities or feats at first level and at least one special ability or feat every level thereafter to emulate the fighter. Much more is probably needed to approximate other classes.

### Balance

Its safe to assume a generic class built in this way is prone to balance issues. Consider combinations that might be more powerful than the more limiting core classes.

Fighter/Rogue: You'd have to spend every other level increasing your base attack bonus to remain on-par with the fighter class. This leaves half your levels available to spend on bonus feats just like a fighter. If you're allowed to use these feats to take rogue special abilities like sneak attack and evasion, does the trade-off make you more powerful than either a fighter or a rogue?

Fighter/Ranger: A ranger is essentially a fighter with bonus feats exchanged for a set of specific class features. Would piecemeal access to these and other abilities result in something more powerful that either a ranger or a fighter?

The 3.5 supplemental _Complete..._ rule-books contain valuable insights into how class features can be modified, mixed, and matched in a balanced way. Prestige classes especially offer alternate progression tracks, and each book contains three supplemental core classes that combine or modify aspects of the traditional classes.
