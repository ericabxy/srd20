Evasion
=======

__Prerequisite:__ Base Reflex save +3.

Improved Evasion
----------------

__Prerequisite:__ Base Reflex save +7.


Notes
-----

Evasion should be locked behind a character's base Reflex saving throw. Sources indicate you can gain evasion initially as early as +3. +7 reserves improved evasion for characters with exceptionally good reflexes.

- Generic (2nd level, Ref +3)
- Monk (2nd level, Ref +3)
- Ranger (9th level, Ref +5)
- Rogue (2nd level, Ref +3)
- Shadowdancer (2nd level, Ref +3)
- Dungeon Delver (4th level, Ref +4)
- Ninja (12th level, Ref +8)
- Scout (5th level, Ref +4)

Evasion and improved evasion typically stack between classes. There is no benefit to gaining it a third time. No class gains it before 2nd level. Generic class bonus feats include the same prerequisites.
