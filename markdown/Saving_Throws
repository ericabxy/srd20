Saving Throws
=============

Historical many.

Third edition consolidation.

Fifth Edition did away with arbitrary saving throws altogether, opting to use all six ability scores for this purpose.

Characters can have a Fighter's Fortitude, a Rogue's Reflexes, or a Wizard's Willpower.

Passive vs Active
-----------------

The three saving throws of Third Edition were not chosen arbitrarily. Compared to many other rolled-for skills, saving throws are passive; they are rolled in response to a threat and often automatically.

Strength: an active ability, exerting muscular power to move something.

Dexterity: although used to actively do things, its tied to the passive concept of reflexes to dodge attacks in combat. It makes sense to include this as a passive/saving ability in the form of __Reflex__.

Constitution: a passive ability representing a body's resilience and endurance and not used to actively do anything. It makes sense to include this as a passive/saving ability in the form of __Fortitude__.

Intelligence: an active ability, using logic and reason to learn, figure things out, and recall knowledge.

Wisdom: a passive ability granting.... It makes sense to include this as a passive/saving ability in the form of __Will__.

Charisma: arguably a passive ability, it has a vague definition and is used for passive and active resolutions.
