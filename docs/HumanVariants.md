Human Variants
--------------

This list is a resource for human variants. The common man is the baseline human and highly customizable. Other backgrounds offer advantages at the expense of extra feats and skill points. Variant humans typically have "any" as a favored class and no ability score adjustments.

Backgrounds are designed to expand the concept of choosing a "race" in D20. There are some advantages that are explicitly genetic, while others are broadly cultural. Compared to "race" a background can include a character's genetic makeup, cultural upbringing, regional affinities, and experience gained during the formative years of adolescence.
