### Desert Dwarves

Because of their skill with stone and engineering, dwarves are acknowledged masters of locating water and digging wells. The importance of water to desert peoples gives the dwarves both great wealth and great political power.

The following traits are in addition to the [dwarf](Races#dwarves) traits, except where noted.


• --2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution: Desert dwarves are tough 
  enough to survive the brutal environment of the desert, but they rely 
  more on cunning and fast talk than agility.

• Heat Endurance: Members of desert races gain a +4 racial bonus 
  on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot weather.

• No stonecunning.

• +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against humanoids of the 
  reptilian subtype (including kobolds and lizardfolk) and dragons 
  (including half-dragons): Desert dwarves are trained in special combat 
  techniques that allow them to fight common enemies more effectively. 
  This bonus replaces the normal dwarf's bonus against orcs and 
  goblinoids.

• +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against dragons: This replaces 
  the dwarf's dodge bonus to AC against giants. Dragons are a more 
  common threat than giants in desert climes, and desert dwarves have 
  adapted to meet this challenge.

• +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (architecture and engineering), 
  Knowledge (dungeoneering), and Profession (miner) checks: Desert 
  dwarves protect a great deal of information about what lives beneath 
  the desert and how to reach it.

• No racial bonus on Craft checks.

### Desert Elves

In the desert, elves follow nomadic lifestyles. They herd horses, cattle, and goats across the sands, sleeping during the day and working or traveling at night. Their wandering takes them many places and puts them in contact with many cultures. As a result, they are welcome everywhere for the news and exotic trade goods they carry. 

The following traits are in addition to the [elf](Races#elves) traits, except where noted.


• --2 Strength, +2 Dexterity: Desert elves are physically 
  weaker than their normal cousins, but are also hardier, toughened by 
  the harsh reality of desert life.

• Heat Endurance: Members of desert races gain a +4 racial bonus 
  on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot weather.

• Weapon Proficiency: Desert elves receive the Martial Weapon 
  Proficiency feats for the scimitar, rapier, and shortbow (including 
  composite shortbow) as bonus feats. Desert elves prefer the scimitar 
  to the longsword and the shortbow to the longbow, because they can use 
  shortbows while mounted.

• +2 racial bonus on Handle Animal and Ride checks: Desert elves 
  spend most of their lives riding and working with animals.

• No racial bonus on Listen checks.

### Desert Gnomes

Desert dwarves may dig and maintain wells, but desert gnomes pay for them. Desert gnomes establish and operate fortified trading posts around wells and oases, cultivating crops wherever possible and scouring the surrounding desert for the wealth of buried civilizations. Desert gnome outposts are rarely quiet, doing business both day and night.

The following traits are in addition to the [gnome](Races#gnomes) traits, except where noted.


• Heat Endurance: Members of desert races gain a +4 racial bonus 
  on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot weather.

• +2 racial bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks: 
  Desert gnomes are skilled at haggling and negotiating.

• No racial bonus on Listen checks or Craft (alchemy) checks.

### Desert Goblins

The following traits are in addition to the goblin traits, except where noted.


• Heat Endurance: Members of desert races gain a +4 racial bonus 
  on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot weather.

• Low-Light Vision: A desert goblin can see twice as far as a 
  human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of 
  poor illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and 
  detail under these conditions.

• No darkvision.

• +2 racial bonus on Gather information checks: Desert goblins 
  soak up gossip like sponges when they visit towns or settlements.

### Desert Half-Elves

The following traits are in addition to the [half-elf](Races#half-elves) traits, except where noted.


• Heat Endurance: Members of desert races gain a +4 racial bonus 
  on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot weather.

• +2 racial bonus on Sense Motive checks: A desert half-elfs 
  survival often relies on his ability to gauge the social situation.

• No racial bonus on Listen checks.

### Desert Half-Orcs

The following traits are in addition to the [half-orc](Races#half-orcs) traits, except where noted.


• +2 Constitution, --2 Intelligence: The desert half-orc is 
  lean and hardy rather than muscular, but has adapted to be more 
  socially adept than a typical half-orc.

• Heat Endurance: Members of desert races gain a +4 racial bonus 
  on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot weather.

• Low-Light Vision: A desert half-orc can see twice as far as a 
  human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of 
  poor illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and 
  detail under these conditions.

• No darkvision.

• Run: Desert half-orcs receive Run as a racial bonus feat. 
  Typically too poor to afford mounts, half-orcs learn from an early age 
  to get from place to place by running.

### Desert Halflings

Like gnomes, halflings are most likely to be active during the day. Most other races regard them somewhat like cats, in that they appear whether invited or not, work at what they want when they want, and disappear without prior notice. A desert gnome proverb observes that “Halflings in your town are a source of trouble, but at least they don't tolerate competition.”

The following traits are in addition to the [halfling](Races#halflings) traits, except where noted.


• Heat Endurance: Members of desert races gain a +4 racial bonus 
  on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot weather.

• +2 racial bonus on Hide and Sleight of Hand checks: Desert 
  halflings are stealthy and nimble-fingered.

• No racial bonus on Climb and Jump checks.

### Desert Kobolds

The following traits are in addition to the [kobold](MonstersK-L#kobold) traits, except where noted.


• --4 Strength, +2 Dexterity, --2 Wisdom: Desert 
  kobolds are hardier than other kobolds, but are weak-willed.

• Heat Endurance: Members of desert races gain a +4 racial bonus 
  on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot weather.

• No light sensitivity.

• +2 racial bonus on Survival checks.

• No racial bonus on Profession (mining) checks: Desert kobolds 
  don't mine.

• Favored Class: Rogue. A multiclass desert kobold's rogue class 
  does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point 
  penalty for multiclassing. This trait replaces the normal kobold's 
  favored class.

### Desert Orcs

The following traits are in addition to the orc traits, except where noted.


• Heat Endurance: Members of desert races gain a +4 racial bonus 
  on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot weather.

• Low-Light Vision: A desert orc can see twice as far as a human 
  in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor 
  illumination. She retains the ability to distinguish color and detail 
  under these conditions.

• No darkvision.

• Endurance: Desert orcs gain Endurance as a racial bonus feat.
