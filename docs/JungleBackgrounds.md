### Jungle Dwarves

Because of their height, dwarves can duck under vegetation that impedes humans—yet they are stockier than gnomes or halflings, and able to bull through what they can't avoid. Hardy to a fault, jungle dwarves are explorers, pathfinders, and traveling merchants. 

The following traits are in addition to the [dwarf](Races#dwarves) traits, except where noted.

• Low-Light Vision: A jungle dwarf can see twice as far as a 
  human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of 
  poor illumination. She retains the ability to distinguish color and 
  detail under these conditions.

• No darkvision.

• +2 bonus on Heal, Knowledge (nature), and Survival checks: 
  Jungle dwarves know a great deal about what lives in the jungle, and 
  are adept at finding it (or avoiding it, as the case may be).

• +2 bonus on Spot checks: Jungle dwarves have keen eyesight.

• No stonecunning: Jungle dwarves live aboveground.

• No racial bonus on Craft checks related to stone or metal 
  items.

• Favored Class: Ranger. A multiclass jungle dwarf's ranger class 
  does not count when determining whether she takes an XP penalty for 
  multiclassing. Jungle dwarves need both outdoor skills and combat 
  proficiency to survive. This trait replaces the normal dwarf's favored 
  class.

### Jungle Elves

Jungle elves are somewhat more primal than their baseline counterparts. In many jungles, ancient elven cities have been swallowed up by the voracious encroachment of trees, vines, and animals, leaving just a shadowy remnant of the population to remember the former glories of their lost civilization. 

The following traits are in addition to the [elf](Races#elves) traits, except where noted.

• Weapon Proficiency: Jungle elves receive the Martial Weapon 
  Proficiency feats for the handaxe, rapier, shortsword, and shortbow 
  (including composite shortbow) as bonus feats. Proficiency with a 
  rapier is a vestige of past glories and an honored tradition among 
  jungle elves. The other weapons are useful tools for survival in their 
  environment.

• +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (history) checks: Jungle elves 
  pride themselves on being the keepers of much lore that has been 
  forgotten to others.

• No ability to notice secret or concealed doors by passing 
  within 5 feet.

### Jungle Gnomes

Jungle gnomes live in and along the mighty rivers that wind through the jungles. A jungle gnome town is often a collection of boats tied together across a river, with channels to allow passing vessels through (after they pay a toll, of course). Jungle gnomes are also seen traveling the rivers, trading what they can find to those they meet along the way. 

The following traits are in addition to the [gnome](Races#gnomes) traits, except where noted.

• No racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds.

• No dodge bonus to Armor Class against giants.

• +2 racial bonus on Climb and Swim checks: Jungle gnomes live 
  their lives clambering in and out of boats, and in and out of the 
  water.

• +2 racial bonus on Craft (shipbuilding) checks: A little lumber 
  and a few simple tools make for a happy and industrious jungle gnome.

• +2 racial bonus on Use Rope checks: Jungle gnomes consider rope 
  the most useful tool on their boats.

• No racial bonus on Listen or Craft (alchemy) checks.

### Jungle Goblins

The following traits are in addition to the goblin traits, except where noted.

• A jungle goblin has a climb speed of 20 feet. Jungle goblins 
  are natural climbers, able to scramble up trees with ease. A jungle 
  goblin has a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. It must make a Climb 
  check to climb any wall or slope with a DC of more than 0, but it 
  always can choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened while 
  climbing. If it chooses an accelerated climb, it moves at double its 
  climb speed and makes a single Climb check at a -5 penalty. It cannot 
  run while climbing. It retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if 
  any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus on their 
  attacks against a climbing jungle goblin. Also, jungle goblins add 
  their Dexterity modifier to Climb checks instead of their Strength 
  modifier.

• Low-Light Vision: A jungle goblin can see twice as far as a 
  human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of 
  poor illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and 
  detail under these conditions.

• No darkvision.

• +4 racial bonus on Jump checks: Jungle goblins are accomplished 
  leapers.

• No racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks.

• Favored Class: Barbarian. A multiclass jungle goblin's 
  barbarian class does not count when determining whether he takes an 
  experience point penalty for multiclassing. This trait replaces the 
  normal goblins favored class.

### Jungle Half-Elves

The following traits are in addition to the [half-elf](Races#half-elves) traits, except where noted.

• +2 racial bonus on Bluff and Sense Motive checks: Jungle 
  half-elves must maintain constant awareness of their place within 
  society.

• No racial bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks.

### Jungle Half-Orcs

The following traits are in addition to the [half-orc](Races#half-orcs) traits, except where noted.

• Low-Light Vision: A jungle half-orc can see twice as far as a 
  human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of 
  poor illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and 
  detail under these conditions.

• No darkvision.

• +2 racial bonus on Climb and Jump checks: Jungle half-orcs move 
  almost as easily through the trees oftheir jungle home as they do on the 
  ground.

### Jungle Halflings

Jungle halflings live a much more settled life than their normal counterparts do. They build villages along rivers and burn clearings in the jungle to plant their crops. In addition, they gather the most abundant food source in their environment, fish, and hunt with poison-tipped weapons.

The following traits are in addition to the [halfling](Races#halflings) traits, except where noted.

• Weapon Proficiency: Jungle Halflings receive the Martial Weapon 
  Proficiency feats for the throwing axe, handaxe, and shortbow 
  (including composite shortbow) as bonus feats. For jungle halflings, 
  the axe is both a practical tool and a ceremonial item. They grow up 
  using the other weapons for hunting and fishing.

• Poison Use: jungle halflings use poison extensively when 
  hunting, and as a result never poison themselves when applying poison 
  to a weapon or when using a poisoned weapon in combat. Jungle 
  halflings make extensive use of poisons harvested from vermin, 
  particularly those that damage Dexterity scores.

• No racial bonus on saving throws. Jungle Halflings have no 
  unusual ability to avoid mishaps.

• +2 racial bonus on Fortitude saying throws against poison: 
  Jungle Halflings have adapted a resistance to their own favorite 
  method of bringing down prey.

• No morale bonus on saving throws against fear: Jungle halflings 
  may be cunning, but they are no braver than other races.

• No racial bonus on attack rolls with slings.

• Favored Class: Barbarian. A multiclass halfling's barbarian 
  class does not count when determining whether she takes an experience 
  point penalty for multiclassing. Jungle halflings live much closer to 
  nature, and must rely on cunning, resourcefulness, persistence, 
  courage, and mercilessness to survive. This trait replaces the normal 
  halfling's favored class.

### Jungle Kobolds

Clouded mountain peaks, many of which have religious or ceremonial importance to those who live below, tower over jungle canopies. Few know of the ancient ruined cities near the rocky summits, concealed amid the clouds. Dwelling in such ancient ruins are the jungle kobolds.

Those few explorers who have reached the cities report that their jungle kobold residents claim to have built them, pointing to reptilian and draconic images on the walls and in the architecture as evidence. The explorers report, however, that the cities were obviously built by and for people larger than the little reptilian humanoids. Jungle kobolds lack the cowardice common to other kobolds, thanks to the isolation of their mountain peak homes. By all reports they show a calmer, more generous side than other kobolds do. 

The following traits are in addition to the [kobold](MonstersK-L#kobold) traits, except where noted.

• --4 Strength, +2 Dexterity, --2 Intelligence: Life at 
  high altitude has toughened jungle kobolds, but their isolation has 
  hindered their intellectual growth.

• Altitude Adaptation: Jungle kobolds are adapted to life at high 
  altitudes, and thus don't suffer altitude sickness. They are always 
  considered acclimated to high altitudes.

• +2 racial bonus on Climb checks: Jungle kobolds add their 
  Dexterity modifier to Climb checks instead of their Strength modifier.

• No racial bonus on Craft (trapmaking) or Profession (miner) 
  checks.

### Jungle Orcs

The following traits are in addition to the orc traits, except where noted.

• Low-Light Vision: A jungle orc can see twice as far as a human 
  in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor 
  illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and detail 
  under these conditions.

• No darkvision.

• +2 racial bonus on Heal and Survival checks: Jungle orcs must 
  be self-sufficient in order to survive their environment.
