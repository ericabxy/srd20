Jotun
-----

Jotnar (singular jotun) are medium humanoids with a distant frost giant lineage. They often live in temperate forests, but retain their affinity for cold.

Jotun characters possess the following racial traits.

__+4 Str, –2 Dex, +2 Con:__ Jotun are tough and strong, but not too nimble.

__Giant:__ Jotnar are not subject to spells or effects that affect humanoids only, such as charm person or dominate person.

__Medium:__ As Medium creatures, Jotun have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

__Speed:__ Jotun base land speed is 30 feet.

__Low-Light Vision:__ A Jotun can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

__Powerful Build (Ex):__ The physical stature of half-giants lets them function in many ways as if they were one size category larger. Whenever a half-giant is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the half-giant is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him. A half-giant is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature’s special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A half-giant can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject’s size category.

__Special Quality:__ Resistance to cold 5.

__Automatic Language:__ Common. Bonus Languages: Draconic, Giant, Gnoll, Ignan.

__Favored Class:__ Barbarian.
