Channeling

Spellcasting and psionics are more similar than they look at first glance. The spell lists have many parallels, and mathematically the psion/wilder have roughly the same daily capacity for manifestations as the wizard/sorcerer has in daily spell slots.

Many psionic manifestations work with astral energy and the astral plane, similar to how a cleric can wield positive or negative energy from their respective planes, and druids can spontaneously channel prepared spell energy into *summon nature's ally*. Psionics are a more advanced form of these spontaneous energy manipulations.

Spell-like abilities with a daily limit are like a simplified representation of a creature's innate psionic power. Even "at will" abilities might represent a psionic creature with an essentially limitless supply of power points. For this reason, its possible to consider psionics to be be a synonym for spell-like abilities.
