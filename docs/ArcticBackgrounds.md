### Arctic Dwarves

In the icy wastes, dwarves are the masters of both ice and stone. They build massive, elaborate defenses of ice and rock around the mines where they dig for copper, silver, gold, and iron.

The following traits are in addition to the [dwarf](Races#dwarves) traits, except where noted.


• +2 Strength, +2 Constitution, --4 Dexterity, --2 Charisma. Arctic dwarves are tough enough to survive the brutal environment of the arctic, but rely on strength and heavy armor rather than agility.

• Cold Endurance: Members of arctic races have a +4 racial bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of cold weather or exposure.

• Icecunning: Arctic dwarves can apply their stonecunning benefits to structures and natural features made of ice, as well as those made of stone.

• +2 racial bonus on Appraise and Craft checks related to items made of ice.

### Arctic Elves

The arctic landscape is dotted here and there with permanent fog banks caused by subterranean heat interacting with snow and ice or warm springs steaming in the freezing air. Hidden in these oases of warmth are the ancient settlements of the elves.

The following traits are in addition to the [elf](Races#elves) traits, except where noted.

• No racial bonus on Search checks.

• No special ability to notice a secret or concealed door within 5 feet without actively looking for it.

### Arctic Gnomes

Arctic gnomes travel the ice and snow on cleverly constructed sleds pulled by immense woolly mammoths. The animals serve as transportation, a source of fibers for weaving, and walls against the elements. The sleds are enclosed, often transporting entire families.

The following traits are in addition to the [gnome](Races#gnomes) traits, except where noted.


• Cold Endurance: Members of arctic races have a +4 racial bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of cold weather or exposure.

• +2 racial bonus on Survival checks: Arctic half-elves spend a great deal of time traveling between elf and human settlements, and are accustomed to surviving in the wilderness.

### Arctic Half-Orcs

Many tribes of arctic orcs eke out a living on the warm slopes of volcanic mountains, herding elk and caribou. often their mutual dependence on sources of fresh water and meat brings them into contact with arctic-dwelling human barbarians.

The following traits are in addition to the [half-orc](Races#half-orcs) traits, except where noted.


• Cold Endurance: Members of arctic races have a +4 racial bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of cold weather or exposure.

• No darkvision.

• +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks: Arctic half-orcs often serve as emissaries for the arctic orc tribes that spawned them.

### Arctic Halflings

Arctic halflings are hunters and fishermen, stalking walrus and seal and putting to sea to fish, usually in the company of larger races such as humans. They are a peaceful, spiritual people whose rituals include preexpedition prayers for forgiveness from the animals they hope to kill.

### Arctic Kobolds

Arctic kobolds are seldom seen outside their mines. They dig constantly, always expanding their subterranean territory (which is often carefully constructed to tap into geothermal vents for heat), and as a result are in constant conflict with arctic dwarves. Arctic kobolds often hire mercenaries to fight for them, hiding behind their carefully constructed traps and other defenses and paying their defenders with the mineral wealth they uncover while expanding their warrens.

The following traits are in addition to the [kobold](MonstersK-L#kobold) traits, except where noted.

• --2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, --2 Constitution, --2 Wisdom: Arctic kobolds are stronger than other kobolds, but are weaker of will.

### Arctic Orcs

Arctic orcs are primitive herders, eking out a living on the slopes of volcanic mountains and building their crude huts near hot springs or steam vents. They herd woolly cattle, caribou, and elk. As a result, they control large sources of meat, water, and heat—all things coveted by others living in or traveling through the arctic.

The following traits are in addition to the orc traits, except where noted.


• Cold Endurance: Members of arctic races have a +4 racial bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of cold weather or exposure.
