## Sneak

###Dexterity, Armor Check Penalty

Characters use the Sneak skill to tread softly and move silently. The character’s Sneak check is opposed by the Listen check of anyone who might hear him. He can move up to one-half his normal speed at no penalty. At more than one-half, and up to the character’s full speed, he suffers a –5 penalty to Sneak. It’s practically impossible (–20 penalty) to sneak around while running or charging.

**Hiding:** Characters can also use Sneak to hide. A character’s Sneak check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone who might see him. The character can move up to one-half normal speed and hide at no penalty. At more than one-half, and up to his full speed, he suffers a –5 penalty. It’s practically impossible (–20 penalty) to hide while running or charging.

Larger and smaller creatures get size bonuses or penalties to Sneak checks made to hide as follows: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large –4, Huge –8, Gargantuan –12, Colossal –16.

If people are observing the character, even casually, he can’t hide. The character can run around a corner to get out of sight and then hide, but the onlookers know at least where he went. However, if the onlookers are momentarily distracted (as by a Bluff check; see below), the character can attempt to hide. While the onlookers turn their attention from the character, he can attempt a Sneak check if he can get to a hiding place of some kind. (As a general guideline, the hiding place has to be within 1 foot for every rank he has in Sneak.) However, the character makes this check at –10 because he has to move fast.

Characters trying to move silently and hide at the same time make only one Sneak check, which is opposed by either Spot or Listen.

The character can use Bluff to help him hide. A successful Bluff check can create the momentary diversion he needs to attempt a Sneak check to hide while people are aware of his presence.
