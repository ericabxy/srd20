Human Racial Traits
-------------------

* __Medium:__ As Medium creatures, humans have no special
bonuses or penalties due to their size.
* Human base speed is 30 feet.
* One extra feat at 1st level (cannot be a talent).
* Bonus of 4 extra skill points at 1st level and 1 extra skill point at each additional level.
* __Automatic Language:__ Common.
* __Bonus Languages:__ Any.

Faen (Loresong) Racial Traits
-----------------------------

* Loresong faen receive a +2 racial bonus to Intelligence and a –2 racial penalty to Strength.
* __Small:__ Because they are Small creatures, all faen gain a +1 size bonus to Armor Class and attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus to all Sneak checks. They must use smaller-sized weapons and equipment, and can lift and carry only three-quarters as much as a Medium character.
* Faen are light-footed and quiet when they wish to be, earning them a +2 racial bonus on Sneak checks.
* Faen base speed is 20 feet.
* Loresong faen have an affinity for magic, which grants
them a +2 racial bonus to Spellcraft.
* __Innate Spell-Like Abilities:__ 1/day— detect magic, ghost sound, and lesser glowglobe. Use the loresong faen’s character level as the caster level.
* __Low-Light Vision:__ Faen can see twice as far as humans in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
* __Metamorphosis:__ Once a faen has achieved at least 3rd character level (in any class[es]), she may choose to undergo a metamorphosis. This can occur only at a time when she would normally gain a new or bonus feat—the metamorphosis is in lieu of the feat. The faen secretes a sticky substance that she wraps around herself. The secretion hardens, forming a chrysalis. The faen then spends 1d4+3 days in the chrysalis, after which she emerges in a completely different form. Even smaller than before, the faen now has gossamer wings that can carry her aloft. She has become a spryte. A faen’s gear taken into the magical chrysalis emerges sized appropriately for the character’s new stature.
* Automatic Languages: Common and Faen.
* Bonus Languages: Any.

Verrik gain a +2 racial bonus to Wisdom and a –2 racial
penalty to Charisma.
Medium: As Medium creatures, verrik have no special
bonuses or penalties due to their size.
Verrik base speed is 30 feet.
Sensory Control: Verrik can selectively shut off their senses.
This means they can willingly blind themselves (taking the
appropriate penalties) to become immune to gaze attacks and
similar visual dangers. They can willingly go deaf and make
themselves impervious to language-based or similar effects.
They can shut off their sense of touch and become immune
to pain effects but suffer a –2 circumstance penalty to attack
rolls, Open Lock or Disable Device attempts, or any other
action the DM rules to be touch-dependent. Shutting off or
reactivating a sense is a standard action.
Innate Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day—contact, sense thoughts, less-
er telekinesis. Use the verrik’s character level as the caster level.
The verrik cannot use the heightened versions of these spells.
Spell Access: Verrik spellcasters always have access to com-
plex psionic spells, even when they normally would have
access only to simple spells.
Automatic Languages: Common and Verrik.
Bonus Languages: Any.
•
Racial Levels: Unlike humans and some other races, verrik
can take a few levels in “verrik” as a class to develop their
racial qualities more fully.
