### Verrik Racial Traits

* Verrik gain a +2 racial bonus to Wisdom and a –2 racial penalty to Charisma.
* **Medium:** As Medium creatures, verrik have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
* Verrik base speed is 30 feet.
* **Sensory Control:** Verrik can selectively shut off their senses. This means they can willingly blind themselves (taking the appropriate penalties) to become immune to gaze attacks and similar visual dangers. They can willingly go deaf and make themselves impervious to language-based or similar effects. They can shut off their sense of touch and become immune to pain effects but suffer a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, Open Lock or Disable Device attempts, or any other action the DM rules to be touch-dependent. Shutting off or reactivating a sense is a standard action.
* **Innate Spell-Like Abilities:** 1/day—*contact, sense thoughts, lesser telekinesis.* Use the verrik’s character level as the caster level. The verrik cannot use the heightened versions of these spells.
* **Spell Access:** Verrik spellcasters always have access to complex psionic spells, even when they normally would have access only to simple spells.
* **Automatic Languages:** Common and Verrik.
* **Bonus Languages:** Any.
* **Racial Levels:** Unlike humans and some other races, verrik can take a few levels in “verrik” as a class to develop their racial qualities more fully.
