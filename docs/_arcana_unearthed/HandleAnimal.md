## Handle Animal

### Charisma, Trained Only

The character can train or handle an animal. The Difficulty Class
and the time required to get a particular effect depend on what the
character is trying to do.

Handle Animal Task           |Time    |DC
-----------------------------|--------|-----------------
Handle a domesticated animal |Varies  |10
“Push” a domesticated animal |Varies  |15
Teach an animal tasks        |2 months|15
-----------------------------|--------|-----------------
Teach an animal unusual tasks|2 months|20
Rear a wild animal           |1 year  |15 + HD of animal
Train a wild animal          |2 months|20 + HD of animal

**Time:** For a task with a specific time frame, the character must spend
half this time (at the rate of three hours per day per animal) working
toward completion of the task before making the skill check. If the
check fails, the character can’t teach, rear, or train that animal. (At that
point, he can quit the failed unfinished attempt.) Should the check suc-
ceed, the character must invest the remainder of the time before the
teaching, rearing, or training is complete. If someone interrupts or if
the character fails to follow the task through to completion, any further
attempts to teach, rear, or train the same animal automatically fail.

**Handle a Domesticated Animal:** Examples of this task include
commanding a trained dog, driving beasts of labor, tending to tired
horses, and so forth.

**“Push” a Domesticated Animal:** To push a domestic animal
means to get more out of it than it usually gives, such as command-
ing a poorly trained dog or driving draft animals for extra effort.

**Teach an Animal Tasks:** This means to teach a domestic animal
some tricks. The character can train one type of animal per rank
(chosen when the ranks are purchased) to obey commands and
perform simple tricks. The character can work with up to three ani-
mals at one time, teaching them general tasks. An animal can be
trained for one general purpose only.

**Teach an Animal Unusual Tasks:** This is similar to teaching an
animal tasks, except that the tasks can be something unusual for
that breed of animal, such as training a dog to be a riding animal.
Alternately, the character can use this aspect of Handle Animal to
train an animal to perform specialized tricks, such as teaching a
horse to rear on command or come at a whistle, or teaching a falcon
to pluck objects from someone’s grasp.

**Rear a Wild Animal:** To rear an animal means to raise a wild
creature from infancy, effectively domesticating it. A handler can
rear up to three creatures of the same type at once. A character can
teach domesticated animals tasks while raising them, or can teach
them tasks as domesticated creatures later.

**Train a Wild Animal:** To train a wild animal means to teach a
wild creature to do certain tricks, but only at the character’s com-
mand. The creature remains wild, though usually controllable.

**Retry:** For handling and pushing domestic animals, retries are
allowed. For training and rearing, they are not.

**Special:** A character with 5 or more ranks of Handle Animal gets
a +2 synergy bonus on Ride checks. An untrained character can use
a Charisma check to handle and push animals.
