## Innuendo

### Wisdom, Trained Only

Using the Innuendo skill, a character can get a message across to
someone else without obviously communicating.
The Difficulty Class for a basic message is 10. This number rises
to DC 15 or 20 for complex messages, especially those that rely on
getting across new information.

A character can also try to discern the hidden message in a con-
versation between two other people using this skill. The Difficulty
Class is the skill check of the person using Innuendo, less a penalty
of –2 for each piece of information the eavesdropper is missing. For
example, if a character eavesdrops on people planning to assassi-
nate a visiting diplomat, the eavesdropper suffers a –2 penalty if he
doesn’t know about the diplomat.

Whether trying to send or intercept a message, a failure by 5
points or more means the character has implied or inferred some
false information.

The DM makes the character’s Innuendo check secretly so the
player doesn’t necessarily know whether the character succeeded.

**Retry:** Generally, retries are allowed when trying to send a mes-
sage, but not when receiving or intercepting one. Each retry carries
the chance of miscommunication.

**Special:** A character with 5 or more ranks in Bluff gets a +2 synergy
bonus on the check to transmit (but not receive) a message.
Characters with 5 or more ranks in Sense Motive get a +2 synergy
bonus on checks to receive or intercept (but not transmit) a message.
