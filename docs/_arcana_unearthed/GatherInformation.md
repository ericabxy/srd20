## Gather Information

### Charisma

By succeeding at a Gather Information skill check (DC 10)—given
an evening with a few gold pieces to use for buying drinks, making
friends, and such—the character can get a general understanding
of a city’s major news items, assuming others have no obvious rea-
sons to withhold the information. The higher the check result, the
better the information.

If a character wants to find out about a specific rumor, specific
item, obtain a map, or do something else along those lines, the dif-
ficulty increases to anywhere from DC 15 to 25 or higher.

**Retry:** Yes, but because each check takes an evening or so to
complete, characters may draw attention to themselves if they
repeatedly pursue a certain type of information.
