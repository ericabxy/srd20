Basic Task Resolution System
----------------------------

These rules assume a standardized system for determining the
success or failure of any given task. That system is as follows:

    d20 roll + any modifiers vs. a target number

The modifiers and target number are determined by the type of
task. If the result of the d20 roll plus the modifiers equals or
exceeds the target number, the task is successful. Any other result
means a failure. For example, on a saving throw or a skill check, the
target number is the Difficulty Class (DC). In an attack roll, the
target number is the Armor Class (AC) of the opponent.

A “natural 20” on the die roll is not an automatic success. A
“natural 1” on the die roll is not an automatic failure. The excep-
tions to this are attack rolls and saving throws.
