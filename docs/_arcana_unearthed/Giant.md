Giant Racial Traits
-------------------

* The giants’ massive physique grants them prodigious strength, but makes them less nimble than other creatures, so they enjoy a +2 racial bonus to Strength but suffer a –2 racial penalty to Dexterity.
* __Giants.__ Unlike most other races, giants are not humanoid in type, but Giant.
* __Medium:__ As Medium creatures, giants have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size. Giants can grow to be very large, however.
* Giant base speed is 30 feet.
* Giants are wise in the ways of dealing with others, earning them a +2 racial bonus to Diplomacy and Sense Motive skill checks.
* Giants enjoy a +2 racial bonus to all Craft skill checks.
* __Automatic Languages:__ Common and Giant.
* __Bonus Languages:__ Any.
* __Racial Levels:__ Unlike humans and some other races, giants can take a few levels in “giant” as a class to become more giantish.
