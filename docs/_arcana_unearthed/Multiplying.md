Multiplying
-----------

Sometimes a special rule makes you multiply a number or a die roll.
As long as you’re applying a single multiplier, multiply the number
normally. When two or more multipliers apply, however, combine
them into a single multiple, with each extra multiple adding 1 less
than its value to the first multiple. Thus, a double (× 2) and a
double (× 2) applied to the same number results in a triple (× 3,
because 2 + 1 = 3).
