Uncanny Dodge
-------------

Barbarian class feature. Earliest BAB +1. Earliest improvement BAB +6.

### Barbarian

- Fist of the Forest: 6th level (2nd plus 5 levels for base attack bonus). 

### Rogue

- Scout: 2nd level.
- Streetfighter: 10th level (5th plus 5 levels for base attack bonus).


Improved Uncanny Dodge
----------------------

Sometimes stacks with uncanny dodge (if the character already has uncanny dodge, gaining uncanny dodge again upgrades it to improved uncanny dodge): assassin, barbarian, dwarven defender, fist of the forest, rogue, shadowdancer, streetfighter. Sometimes this does not happen: scout.

Always at least a two-level gap in gaining improved uncanny dodge after uncanny dodge (unless there's a way to do it using prestige classes).

Notes
-----

Tied to base attack bonus because it is an ability derived from combat experience. Classes that don't have a good Reflex save still gain this class feature.
