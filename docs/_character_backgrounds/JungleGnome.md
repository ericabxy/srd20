Jungle Gnome
------------

Jungle gnomes live in and along the mighty rivers that wind through the jungles. A jungle gnome town is often a collection of boats tied together across a river, with channels to allow passing vessels through (after they pay a toll, of course). Jungle gnomes are also seen traveling the rivers, trading what they can find to those they meet along the way.

* +2 Constitution, –2 Strength.
* Small: As a Small creature, a jungle gnome gains a +1 size bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks, but he uses smaller weapons than humans use, and his lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.
* Jungle gnome base land speed is 20 feet.
 Low-Light Vision: A gnome can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
* Weapon Familiarity: Gnomes may treat gnome hooked hammers as martial weapons rather than exotic weapons.
* +2 racial bonus on saving throws against illusions.
* Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against illusion spells cast by gnomes. This adjustment stacks with those from similar effects.
* +2 racial bonus on Climb and Swim checks: Jungle gnomes live their lives clambering in and out of boats, and in and out of the water.
* +2 racial bonus on Craft (shipbuilding) checks: A little lumber and a few simple tools make for a happy and industrious jungle gnome.
* +2 racial bonus on Use Rope checks: Jungle gnomes consider rope the most useful tool on their boats.
* Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day—speak with animals (burrowing mammal only, duration 1 minute). A gnome with a Charisma score of at least 10 also has the following spell-like abilities: 1/day—dancing lights, ghost sound, prestidigitation. Caster level 1st; save DC 10 + gnome’s Cha modifier + spell level.
* Favored Class: Bard.
