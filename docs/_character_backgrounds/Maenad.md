Maenad
------

### Maenad Traits

Maenad characters possess the following racial traits.

* __Medium:__ As Medium creatures, maenads have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
* Maenad base land speed is 30 feet.
* __Sonic Affinity:__ Maenad spellcasters add +1 to the DC of any spell they cast with the sonic descriptor.
* __Outburst (Ex):__ Once per day, for up to 4 rounds, a maenad can subjugate her mentality to gain a boost of raw physical power. When she does so, she takes a –2 penalty to Int and Wis but gains a +2 bonus to Str.
* __Innate Rage:__ 
* __Favored Class:__ [Sorcerer](ClassesII#sorcerer).

### Experimental

__Channeling:__ Maenad spellcasters gain bonus spells as if the governing ability score were 2 points higher. This benefit does not grant them the ability to cast spells unless they gain that ability through levels in a spellcaster class.

_Sonic Ray (Sp):_ Once per day as a standard action, a maenad can create a ray of sonic energy that shoots forth from her fingertip accompanied by a tremendous scream of rage. The ray strikes a target within 25 feet + 5 feet per 4 character levels, dealing 1d6–1 points of sonic damage if the maenad succeeds on a ranged touch attack with the ray.
