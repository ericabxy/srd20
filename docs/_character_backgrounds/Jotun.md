Jotun
-----

Jotnar (singular jotun) are medium humanoids with a distant frost giant lineage. They often live in temperate forests, but retain their affinity for cold.

Jotun elites are often barbarians, clerics, fighters, or sorcerers.

### Jotun Traits

Jotun characters possess the following background traits.

* __+4 Str, –2 Dex, +2 Con:__ Jotnar are tough and strong, but not too nimble.
* __Giant:__ Jotnar are not subject to spells or effects that affect humanoids only, such as charm person or dominate person.
* __Medium:__ As Medium creatures, Jotnar have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
* Jotun base land speed is 30 feet.
* __Powerful Build (Ex):__ The physical stature of jotnar lets them function in many ways as if they were one size category larger. Whenever a jotun is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the jotun is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him. A jotun is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature’s special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A jotun can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject’s size category.
* __Cold Endurance:__ Jotnar have a +4 racial bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of cold weather or exposure.
