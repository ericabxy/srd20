Waterborn
---------

Due to generations of selective breeding and gene therapy, some humans are born with genetic traits that allow them spend more time underwater and act with less restriction while swimming.

### Waterborn Traits

* Medium-size: No special bonuses or penalties due to size.
* Waterborn base land speed is 30 feet.
* A waterborn has a swim speed of 15 feet. It can move through calm water at its indicated speed without making Swim checks. See [Swim Speed](#swim-speed) for details.
* Low-light Vision: A waterborn can see twice as far as normal in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
* Hold Breath: Waterborn can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 x their Constitution score before they risk drowning.
* Automatic Languages: Anglic. Bonus Languages: Any.
* Favored Class: Any.

### Swim Speed

A creature with a swim speed can move through calm water at its indicated speed without making Swim checks. It gains a +8 genetic bonus on any Swim check to perform a special action or avoid a hazard. The creature always can choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered when swimming. Such a creature can use the run action while swimming, provided that it swims in a straight line.

Experimental
------------

As a less-effective alternative to having a swim speed, waterborn might have a swimming special ability. But this is a worse trade-off

* Swimming: Waterborn gain a +4 genetic bonus on all Swim checks. They can always take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered when swimming.
