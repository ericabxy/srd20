Gnoll
-----

Gnolls are hyena-headed humanoids descended from a tribal society. They are covered in short hair, often reddish-brown or dingy yellow.

Gnolls tend to favor the ranger class.

### Gnoll Traits

* +2 Constitution, --2 Intelligence, --2 Charisma.
* Gnoll base speed is 30 feet.
* Medium-size: As Medium creatures, gnolls have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
* Low-Light Vision: Gnolls can see twice as far as normal in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
* +2 racial bonus on Handle Animal and Move Silently checks.
* Run: When running, gnolls move five times their normal speed (if wearing medium, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load). See the (run)[Feats#run] feat.
