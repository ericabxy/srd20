Elan
----

Elans are formerly human creatures sustained by and infused with supernatural energies. The typical elan stands just under 6 feet tall and weighs in the neighborhood of 180 pounds, with men sometimes taller and heavier than women, but not always.

Elans generally favor the wizard class.

### Elan Traits

* +2 Wisdom, −2 Charisma.
* Elan base land speed is 30 feet.
* __Aberration:__ Elans are not subject to spells or effects that affect humanoids only, such as charm person or dominate person.
* __Medium:__ As Medium creatures, elans have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
* __Supernatural Abilities:__ Elans can channel energy to manifest supernatural powers. They can use these abilities a number of times per day equal to 1/2 character level &times; Charisma modifier (mimimum 2). In addition, elan spellcasters can "lose" any prepared arcane spell in order to use one of these abilities instead.
  * _Resistance (Su):_ Elans can channel energy to increase their resistance to various forms of attack. As an immediate action, an elan can expend one energy channeling use to gain a +4 racial bonus on saving throws until the beginning of her next action.
  * _Resilience (Su):_ When an elan takes damage, she can channel energy to reduce its severity. As an immediate action, she can reduce the damage she is about to take by 2 hit points for every energy channeling use she expends.
  * _Repletion (Su):_ An elan can sustain her body without need of food or water. If she expends a single energy channeling use, an elan does not need to eat or drink for 24 hours.

Experimental
------------

__Channeling:__ Elan spellcasters gain bonus spells as if the governing ability score were 2 points higher. This benefit does not grant them the ability to cast spells unless they gain that ability through levels in a spellcaster class.
