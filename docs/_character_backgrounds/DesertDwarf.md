Desert Dwarf
------------

Because of their skill with stone and engineering, dwarves are acknowledged masters of locating water and digging wells. The importance of water to desert peoples gives the dwarves both great wealth and great political power.

* --2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution: Desert dwarves are tough  enough to survive the brutal environment of the desert, but they rely more on cunning and fast talk than agility.
* Medium: As Medium creatures, desert dwarves have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
* Desert dwarf base land speed is 20 feet. However, desert dwarves can move at this speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load (unlike other creatures, whose speed is reduced in such situations).
* Darkvision: Dwarves can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and dwarves can function just fine with no light at all.
* Heat Endurance: Members of desert races gain a +4 racial bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot weather.
* Weapon Familiarity: Dwarves may treat dwarven waraxes and dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons.
* Stability: A dwarf gains a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying, riding, or otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).
* +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison.
* +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects.
* +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against humanoids of the reptilian subtype (including kobolds and lizardfolk) and dragons (including half-dragons): Desert dwarves are trained in special combat techniques that allow them to fight common enemies more effectively.
* +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against dragons: This replaces the dwarf's dodge bonus to AC against giants. Dragons are a more common threat than giants in desert climes, and desert dwarves have adapted to meet this challenge.
* +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal
items.
* <ins>+2 racial bonus on Knowledge (architecture and engineering), Knowledge (dungeoneering), and Profession (miner) checks: Desert dwarves protect a great deal of information about what lives beneath the desert and how to reach it.</ins>
