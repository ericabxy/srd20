MONSTERS (ANIMALS)

This section provides statistics and basic information for many common
kinds of mundane animals. These creatures generally operate on instinct,
driven by simple needs such as food and reproduction. Most animals, even
predators, do not attack unless they or their young are threatened.

Animals are not capable of detailed reasoning, although with the Handle
Animal skill it is possible to tame an animal and teach it to perform
certain tricks.

<u>Some herbivorous animals do not normally use their natural weapons to
attack. As such, their natural weapons are treated as secondary attacks.
The animal’s attack and damage entries note this fact, with an
explanatory footnote.</u>

**Animal Traits:** An animal possesses the following traits (unless
otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).

<u>—Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (no creature with an Intelligence score
of 3 or higher can be an animal).</u>

—Low-light vision.

—*Alignment: *Always neutral. Animals are not governed by a human sense
of morality.

—*Treasure: *None. Animals never possess treasure.

<u>Camels are known for their ability to travel long distances without
food or water.</u>

<u>The statistics presented here are for the dromedary, or one-humped
camel, which thrives in warm deserts. A dromedary stands about 7 feet
tall at the shoulder, with its hump rising 1 foot higher. The
two-humped, or Bactrian, camel is suited to cooler, rocky areas. It is
stockier, slower (speed 40 feet), and has a higher Constitution score
(16).</u>

**<u>Carrying Capacity:</u>**<u> A light load for a camel is up to 300
pounds; a medium load, 301–600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601–900 pounds.
A camel can drag 4,500 pounds.</u>

<u>Cheetahs are swift feline predators of the plains. A cheetah is 3 to
5 feet long and weighs 110 to 130 pounds.</u>

<u>Combat</u>

<u>Cheetahs make sudden sprints to bring down prey.</u>

**Trip (Ex): **A cheetah that hits with a claw or bite attack can
attempt to trip the opponent (+3 check modifier) as a free action
without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If
the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the cheetah.

**Sprint (Ex): **Once per hour, a cheetah can move ten times its normal
speed (500 feet) when it makes a charge.

<u>Crocodiles are aggressive predators 11 to 12 feet long. They lie
mostly submerged in rivers or marshes, with only their eyes and nostrils
showing, waiting for prey to come within reach.</u>

<u>Combat</u>

**<u>Improved Grab (Ex):</u>**<u> To use this ability, a crocodile must
hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a
free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the
grapple check, the crocodile establishes a hold on the opponent with its
mouth and drags it into deep water, attempting to pin it to the
bottom.</u>

**<u>Hold Breath (Ex):</u>**<u> A crocodile can hold its breath for a
number of rounds equal to 4 x its Constitution score before it risks
drowning.</u>

**<u>Skills: </u>**<u>A crocodile has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim
check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always
choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It
can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight
line. \*A crocodile gains a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks when in the
water. Further, a crocodile can lie in the water with only its eyes and
nostrils showing, gaining a +10 cover bonus on Hide checks.</u>

<u>Hyenas are pack hunters infamous for their cunning and their
unnerving vocalizations. The statistics presented here are for a striped
hyena, which is about 3 feet long and weighs about 120 pounds.</u>

<u>Combat</u>

<u>A favorite tactic is to send a few individuals against the foe’s
front while the rest of the pack circles and attacks from the flanks or
rear.</u>

**<u>Trip (Ex): </u>**<u>A hyena that hits with its bite attack can
attempt to trip the opponent (+2 check modifier) as a free action
without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If
the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the hyena. </u>

**<u>Skills:</u>**<u> \*Hyenas have a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks in
areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth.</u>

<u>These bottom-dwelling sea creatures are dangerous only to their prey.

<u>Combat</u>

**<u>Improved Grab (Ex):</u>**<u> To use this ability, an octopus must
hit an opponent of any size with its arms attack. It can then attempt to
start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and
automatically deals bite damage.</u>

**<u>Ink Cloud (Ex):</u>**<u> An octopus can emit a cloud of jet-black
ink 10 feet high by 10 feet wide by 10 feet long once per minute as a
free action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the octopus
normally uses to escape a losing fight. All vision within the cloud is
obscured.</u>

**<u>Jet (Ex):</u>**<u> An octopus can jet backward once per round as a
full-round action, at a speed of 200 feet. It must move in a straight
line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.</u>

**<u>Skills:</u>**<u> An octopus can change colors, giving it a +4
racial bonus on Hide checks. An octopus also can squeeze and contort its
body, giving it a +10 racial bonus on Escape Artist checks. An octopus
has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action
or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even
if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming,
provided it swims in a straight line.</u>

<u>These creatures are aggressive and territorial hunters, with arms
reaching 10 feet or more in length. Their tentacles are studded with
barbs and sharp-edged suckers.</u>

<u>Combat</u>

<u>An opponent can attack a giant octopus’s tentacles with a sunder
attempt as if they were weapons. A giant octopus’s tentacles have 10 hit
points each. If a giant octopus is currently grappling a target with the
tentacle that is being attacked, it usually uses another limb to make
its attack of opportunity against the opponent making the sunder
attempt. Severing one of a giant octopus’s tentacles deals 5 points of
damage to the creature. A giant octopus usually withdraws from combat if
it loses four tentacles. The creature regrows severed limbs in 1d10+10
days.</u>

**<u>Constrict (Ex): </u>**<u>A giant octopus deals 2d8+6 points of
damage with a successful grapple check.</u>

<u>The statistics presented here describe a small horse, under 5 feet
tall at the shoulder. Ponies are otherwise similar to light horses and
cannot fight while carrying a rider.</u>

<u>Combat</u>

<u>\*A pony not trained for war does not normally use its hooves to
attack but rather to run. Its hoof attack is treated as a secondary
attack and adds only half the pony’s Strength bonus to damage.</u>

**<u>Carrying Capacity: </u>**<u>A light load for a pony is up to 75
pounds; a medium load, 76–150 pounds; and a heavy load, 151–225 pounds.
A pony can drag 1,125 pounds.</u>

<u>Porpoises are mammals that tend to be playful, friendly, and helpful.
A typical porpoise is 4 to 6 feet long and weighs 110 to 160 pounds. The
statistics presented here can describe any small whale of similar
size.</u>

<u>Combat</u>

**<u>Blindsight (Ex): </u>**<u>Porpoises can “see” by emitting
high-frequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allow
them to locate objects and creatures within 120 feet. A </u>*<u>silence
</u>*<u>spell negates this and forces the porpoise to rely on its
vision, which is approximately as good as a human’s.</u>

**<u>Hold Breath (Ex): </u>**<u>A porpoise can hold its breath for a
number of rounds equal to 6 x its Constitution score before it risks
drowning.</u>

**<u>Skills: </u>**<u>A porpoise has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check
to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose
to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. \*A
porpoise has a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Listen checks. These bonuses
are lost if its blindsight is negated.</u>

<u>These carnivorous fish are aggressive and liable to make unprovoked
attacks against anything that approaches them. Smaller sharks are from 5
to 8 feet long and not usually dangerous to creatures other than their
prey. Large sharks can reach around 15 feet in length and are a serious
threat. Huge sharks are true monsters, like great whites, that can
exceed 20 feet in length.</u>

<u>Combat</u>

<u>Sharks circle and observe potential prey, then dart in and bite with
their powerful jaws.</u>

**<u>Blindsense (Ex): </u>**<u>A shark can locate creatures underwater
within a 30-foot radius. This ability works only when the shark is
underwater.</u>

**<u>Keen Scent (Ex): </u>**<u>A shark can notice creatures by scent in
a 180-foot radius and detect blood in the water at ranges of up to a
mile. </u>

**<u>Skills:</u>**<u> A shark has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
</u>

<u>SNAKE</u>

<u>Snakes usually are not aggressive and flee when confronted.</u>

**<u>Skills:</u>**<u> Snakes have a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, and
Spot checks and a +8 racial bonus on Balance and Climb checks. A snake
can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or
threatened. Snakes use either their Strength modifier or Dexterity
modifier for Climb checks, whichever is higher. A snake has a +8 racial
bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a
hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if
distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming,

<u>Constrictor snakes usually are not aggressive and flee when
confronted. They hunt for food but do not attempt to make a meal out of
any creature that is too large to constrict.</u>

<u>Combat</u>

<u>Constrictor snakes hunt by grabbing prey with their mouths and then
squeezing it with their powerful bodies.</u>

**<u>Constrict (Ex):</u>**<u> On a successful grapple check, a
constrictor snake deals 1d3+4 points of damage.</u>

**<u>Improved Grab (Ex):</u>**<u> To use this ability, a constrictor
snake must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a
grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If
it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.</u>

<u>These creatures range widely in size. They are not particularly
aggressive, but will often lash out with a bite attack before attempting
to retreat.</u>

<u>Combat</u>

<u>Viper snakes rely on their venomous bite to kill prey and defend
themselves.</u>

<u>Poison (Ex): A viper snake has a poisonous bite that deals initial
and secondary damage of 1d6 Con. The save DC varies by the snake’s size,
as shown on the table below. The save DCs are Constitution-based.</u>

<u>These free-swimming mollusks are fairly aggressive. They are more
feared than sharks in some locales.</u>

<u>Combat</u>

**<u>Improved Grab (Ex): </u>**<u>To use this ability, a squid must hit
an opponent of any size with its arms attack. It can then attempt to
start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of
opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and
automatically deals bite damage. \*A squid has a +4 racial bonus on
grapple checks.</u>

**<u>Ink Cloud (Ex):</u>**<u> A squid can emit a cloud of jet-black ink
10 feet high by 10 feet wide by 10 feet long once per minute as a free
action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the squid normally
uses to escape a losing fight. All vision within the cloud is obscured.
</u>

**<u>Jet (Ex):</u>**<u> A squid can jet backward once per round as a
full-round action, at a speed of 240 feet. It must move in a straight
line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.</u>

**<u>Skills:</u>**<u> A squid has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line</u>

<u>These voracious creatures can have bodies more than 20 feet long and
attack almost anything they meet.</u>

<u>Combat</u>

<u>An opponent can attack a giant squid’s tentacles with a sunder
attempt as if they were weapons. A giant squid’s tentacles have 10 hit
points each. If a giant squid is currently grappling a target with the
tentacle that is being attacked, it usually uses another limb to make
its attack of opportunity against the opponent making the sunder
attempt. Severing one of a giant squid’s tentacles deals 5 points of
damage to the creature. A giant squid usually withdraws from combat if
it loses five tentacles. The creature regrows severed limbs in 1d10+10
days.</u>

**<u>Constrict (Ex): </u>**<u>A giant squid deals 1d6+8 points of damage
with a successful grapple check.</u>

**<u>Improved Grab (Ex): </u>**<u>To use this ability, a giant squid
must hit an opponent of any size with a tentacle attack. It can then
attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack
of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and
can constrict. \*A giant squid has a +4 racial bonus on grapple
checks.</u>

**<u>Ink Cloud (Ex): </u>**<u>A giant squid can emit a cloud of
jet-black ink 20 feet high by 20 feet wide by 20 feet long once per
minute as a free action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the
squid normally uses to escape a losing fight. All vision within the
cloud is obscured.</u>

**<u>Jet (Ex): </u>**<u>A giant squid can jet backward once per round as
a full-round action, at a speed of 320 feet. It must move in a straight
line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.</u>

**<u>Skills:</u>**<u> A giant squid has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim
check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always
choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It
can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight
line.</u>

Dexterity modifier for Climb checks. A weasel can always choose to take
10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.</u>

<u>WHALE</u>

<u>Some varieties of these seagoing mammals are among the largest
animals known. Relatively small whales (such as the orca presented here)
can be vicious predators, attacking virtually anything they detect.</u>

**<u>Blindsight (Ex):</u>**<u> Whales can “see” by emitting
high-frequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allow
them to locate objects and creatures within 120 feet. A </u>*<u>silence
</u>*<u>spell negates this and forces the whale to rely on its vision,
which is approximately as good as a human’s.</u>

**<u>Hold Breath (Ex):</u>**<u> A whale can hold its breath for a number
of rounds equal to 8 x its Constitution score before it risks drowning.
</u>

**<u>Skills:</u>**<u> A whale has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to
perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use
the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. \*A
whale has a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Listen checks. These bonuses are
lost if its blindsight is negated.</u>

<u>Wolves are pack hunters known for their persistence and cunning.</u>

<u>Combat</u>

<u>A favorite tactic is to send a few individuals against the foe’s
front while the rest of the pack circles and attacks from the flanks or
rear.</u>

**<u>Trip (Ex): </u>**<u>A wolf that hits with a bite attack can attempt
to trip the opponent (+1 check modifier) as a free action without making
a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt
fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the wolf. </u>

**<u>Skills:</u>**<u> \*Wolves have a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks
when tracking by scent.</u>

even more ferocious.</u>
