Animal Companion
----------------

__Prerequisite:__ Diving spellcasting.

You may begin play with an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures are also available: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies you on your adventures as appropriate for its kind.

Your 1st-level companion is completely typical for its kind except as noted below. As you advance in caster levels, the animal’s power increases as shown on the table. If you release your companion from service, you may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.

At caster level 4th or higher you may select from alternative lists of animals (see below). Should you select an animal companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if your level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the appropriate list header from your level and compare the result with the level entry on the table to determine the animal companion’s powers. (If this adjustment would reduce your effective level to 0 or lower, you can’t have that animal as a companion.)
