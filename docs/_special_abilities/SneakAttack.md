Sneak Attack, an ability associated with the rogue core class, is used across a myriad of other classes and prestige classes in modified form. Bonus damage typically stacks, unless the ability is renamed.

Classless limits: Experience rank? (+1 at 1st level and increases by +1 every 4 levels thereafter)

Bonuses do stack.

Notes
-----

Sneak attack is a combat ability but classes tend to gain its benefits regardless of being especially stealthy or dexterous. Its being gated behind base attack bonus to represent this nature. Any character can gain it at first level, but improving it depends on how their attack bonus progresses. A rogue-like character with a little combat focus can gain it every two levels. A wizard-like character with only a basic (poor) base attack bonus would struggle to gain sneak attack as few as seven times in twenty levels.

6th +3 +3d6
10th +5 +4d6
12th +6 +5d6
16th +8 +6d6
18th +9 +7d6
