Suggestion
----------

__Prerequisite:__ 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill, ability to cast arcane spells.

You can make a *suggestion* (as the spell) to a creature that you have already [fascinated](Fascinate). Using this ability does not break your concentration on the *fascinate* effect, nor does it allow a second saving throw against the *fascinate* effect.

Making a *suggestion* doesn’t count against you daily limit on bardic music performances. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 character's level + character’s Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature (but see *mass suggestion*, below). *Suggestion* is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language dependent ability.
