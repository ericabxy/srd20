Divine Spellcasting
-------------------

All spells available to both clerics and druids are listed here. If one learned the spell later than the other, its listed at the later level. Which spells you have access to should really be determined by some other factor (your patron deity, the kind of natural forces you vibe with most, etc.), but this document serves as a baseline for now.

Divine Spellcasting, 1st-level
------------------------------

You meditate or pray for your spells. You must choose a time at which you must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain your daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether you can prepare spells. You may prepare and cast any spell you have access to, provided that you can cast spells of that level, but you must choose which spells to prepare during your daily meditation.

You gain access to the following spells: (orisons) 3/day---*create water, cure minor wounds, detect magic, detect poison, guidance, hide from undead/animals, light, magic weapon/fang, mending, purify food and drink, read magic, resistance, virtue*. (1st-level) 1/day---*cure light wounds, endure elements, magic stone, obscuring mist, summoning--1*.

Caster Level
------------

Dedicated spellcasters have a caster level equal to the number of times they have gained any divine spellcasting ability in this document.

Rangers and Paladins have a lower caster level due to learning magic at a slower rate. Their caster level is 1/2 their class level, so the assumption is that they gain divine spellcasting every other level rather than once per level. Of course, they have lower daily caps as well, and start learning at a later level.
