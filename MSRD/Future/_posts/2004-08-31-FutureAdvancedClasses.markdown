### Class Features

The following class features pertain to the Ambassador advanced class.

##### Diplomatic Immunity

Starting at 1st level, if the Ambassador is arrested for a crime, she
can make a Diplomacy check to invoke her diplomatic credentials and not
suffer the usual legal penalty or punishment. The severity of the crime
determines the DC of the Diplomacy check, and how authorities react if
the Ambassador succeeds. See Table: Diplomatic Immunity for Diplomacy
check DCs based on the severity of the crime.

If one of the Ambassador’s consuls (see the select consul class feature,
below) is arrested for a crime and unable to secure her own release, the
Ambassador may intercede on the consul’s behalf. One may aid the other’s
Diplomacy check.

An Ambassador who routinely invokes the privilege of diplomatic
immunity—either on her own behalf or to protect her selected consuls—is
likely to be recalled or terminated by those she has sworn to represent.

</table>

**Open Arms**

Beginning at 2nd level, the Ambassador is skilled at initiating peaceful
negotiations. She may add a competence bonus equal to one-half her
Ambassador class level on all Diplomacy checks.

**Bonus Feats**

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Ambassador gets a bonus feat. The bonus
feat must be selected from the following list, and the Ambassador must
meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it. Attentive,
Defensive Martial Arts, Dodge, Educated, Improved Initiative, Low
Profile, Oathbound, Renown, Trustworthy.

**Information Access**

Starting at 4th level, the Ambassador can make Gather Information checks
without spending money or making Wealth checks, provided she is dealing
with individuals or organizations that are helpful, friendly,
indifferent, or unfriendly toward her or those she represents. Dealing
with individuals or organizations that are hostile requires the
Ambassador to make Wealth checks as usual when using the Gather
Information skill.

**Stipend**

Skilled diplomats are well paid for their loyalty and dedication, and
they are accustomed to traveling in style. At 5th level, and again at
8th level, the Ambassador gains a one-time Wealth bonus increase
of +4.

**Restricted Access**

At 7th level, the Ambassador gains clearance to access restricted files
or classified information from any source that recognizes her faction,
organization, nation, world, or stellar empire. She gains a +5 bonus on
Computer Use checks made to defeat computer security and a +5 bonus on
Research checks.

**Select Consuls**

At 10th level, the Ambassador may appoint a number of individuals equal
to her Reputation bonus as “consuls” or “attachés.” These appointed
individuals gain all the benefits of the diplomatic immunity,
information access, and restricted access class features (described
above). The Ambassador may revoke these privileges at any time and
appoint replacement consuls as she sees fit. It takes 1d4 hours for an
Ambassador to invoke or revoke a consul’s or attaché’s privileges.

### Class Features

The following class features pertain to the Dogfighter advanced class.

**Bonus Feats**

At 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Dogfighter gets a bonus feat. The
bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Dogfighter
must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.

Blind-Fight, Brawl, Gearhead, Improved Brawl, Improved Feint, Spacer,
Starship Battle Run, Starship Dodge, Starship Feint, Starship Gunnery,
Starship Mobility, Starship Operation, Starship Strafe, Zero-G Training.

**Defender Of The Universe**

Starting at 2nd level, a Dogfighter applies his Reputation bonus to the
die result whenever he spends an action point to modify an attack roll,
skill check, ability check, or saving throw made aboard a starship.

**Shake, Rattle, And Roll**

At 4th level, a Dogfighter learns how rock an enemy starship with
weapons fire. The Dogfighter must declare that he is using this ability
before making the attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the
attempt). A starship damaged by the Dogfighter’s attack is shaken for 1
round; all passengers and crewmembers (pilots and gunners included)
aboard the shaken ship take a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws,
and skill checks for 1 round. A Dogfighter may use this ability once per
day at 4th level, twice per day at 7th level, and three times per day at
10th level.

**To the max!**

At 5th level and beyond, a Dogfighter can coax more thrust out of a
ship’s engines, increasing its tactical speed by +500 feet. The
Dogfighter must be piloting the ship to increase its tactical speed.

**Keep It Together**

At 8th level, a Dogfighter can continue to operate a starship even after
it has been reduced to negative hit points and has begun breaking apart.
The ship may take one move action or one attack action each round.
However, the ship cannot be repaired and continues to lose 1 hit point
per round, exploding once it reaches its destruction threshold. The
Dogfighter and all other personnel aboard the ship are considered
shaken, taking a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill
checks.

### Class Features

The following class features pertain to the Dreadnought advanced class.

**Fearless**

The Dreadnought is immune to fear effects.

**Stability**

The Dreadnought is incredibly sure-footed. She gains a +4 stability
bonus on all rolls made to resist being tripped, overrun, knocked prone,

At 2nd level, the Dreadnought can temporarily increase her Strength, but
at a penalty to Defense. At 5th and 8th level, she can use this ability
more frequently.

The Dreadnought gains a +8 morale bonus to Strength, but takes a –2
penalty to Defense. Activating ability surge is a free action, and the
surge lasts for a number of rounds equal to the Dreadnought’s class
level. Following the ability surge, the Dreadnought is fatigued for as
many rounds as she surged, but may negate this penalty as a free action
by spending an action point. The Dreadnought may use the ability surge
once per day at 2nd level, twice per day at 5th level, and three times
per day at 8th level.

**Steamroller**

Starting at 2nd level, the Dreadnought does not need to move before
making an overrun attempt against an opponent. She also gains a +2 bonus
on any trip attack made against an opponent who blocks her overrun
attempt.

**Bonus Feats**

Toughness, Two-Weapon Fighting, Ultra Immune System.

**Master Defender**

Starting at 4th level, the Dreadnought becomes especially skilled in
defensive fighting. Whenever she fights defensively or takes the total
defense action, she gains a +2 bonus to Defense (in addition to the
dodge bonus to Defense gained while fighting defensively or engaged in
total defense).

The Dreadnought must be wearing medium, heavy, or powered armor to gain
this bonus.

The bonus increases to +4 at 7th level and +6 and 10th level.

**Knockdown**

At 5th level and beyond, whenever the Dreadnought is allowed to apply
her Strength modifier to damage, she forces the target of her successful
attack to make at a Fortitude save (DC = damage dealt) or be knocked
prone by the force of the blow.

**Heavy Artillery**

Beginning at 8th level, a Dreadnought treats all weapons as one size
category smaller for purposes of determining whether or not she can
wield them in one hand and if they are considered light weapons.

### Class Features

The following class features pertain to the Engineer advanced class.

**Builder**

At 1st level, the Engineer gains the bonus feat Builder.

**Improve Kit (+1)**

An engineer can use his know-how to upgrade an electrical or mechanical
tool kit at no additional cost.

*Electrical Tool Kit, Basic:* For the cost of a basic electrical tool
kit, an Engineer can assemble a mastercraft (+1) version of the kit that
grants a +1 equipment bonus on all Repair checks made to fix electrical
devices.

*Electrical Tool Kit, Deluxe:* For the cost of a deluxe electrical tool
k it, an Engineer can assemble a mastercraft (+1) version that grants a
+3 equipment bonus (instead of the usual +2 equipment bonus) on all
Repair checks made to fix electrical devices and a +1 equipment bonus on
all Craft (electrical) checks.

*Mechanical Tool Kit, Basic:* For the cost of a basic mechanical tool
kit, an Engineer can assemble a mastercraft (+1) version of the kit that
grants a +1 equipment bonus on all Repair checks made to fix mechanical
devices.

*Mechanical Tool Kit, Deluxe:* For the cost of a deluxe mechanical kit,
an Engineer can assemble a mastercraft (+1) version that grants a +3
equipment bonus (instead of the usual +2 equipment bonus) on all Repair
checks made to fix mechanical devices and a +1 equipment bonus on all
Craft (mechanical) and Craft (structural) checks.

### Quick Craft

At 2nd level, an engineer learns how to craft ordinary scratch-built
electronic, mechanical, and structural objects more quickly than normal.

When using the Craft (electronic), Craft (mechanical), or Craft
(structural) skill to build an ordinary scratch-built item, the Engineer
reduces the building time by one-quarter.

At 5th level, the Engineer reduces the building time of ordinary objects
and mastercraft objects by half.

**Superior Repair**

At 2nd level, an Engineer learns improved ways of repairing robots,
vehicles, mecha, starships, and cybernetic attachments.

An Engineer with a mechanical tool kit and an appropriate facility (a
workshop, garage, or hangar) can repair damage to a robot, vehicle,
mecha, starship, or cybernetic attachment. (Without a mechanical tool
kit, the Engineer takes a –4 penalty on the Repair check.) With 1 hour
of work, the engineer can restore a number of hit points based on his
Repair check result, as shown in Table: Superior Repair. If damage
remains, the Engineer may continue to make repairs for as many hours as
needed to fully repair the damaged robot, vehicle, mecha, starship, or
cybernetic attachment.

**Bonus Feats**

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Engineer gets a bonus feat. The bonus
feat must be selected from the following list, and the Engineer must
meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.

Aircraft Operation (spacecraft), Builder, Cautious, Gearhead,
Mastercrafter, Salvage, Surface Vehicle Operation, Vehicle Expert,
Zero-G Training.

**Improve Kit (+2)**

At 4th level, the Engineer can assemble mastercraft (+2) electrical and
mechanical tool kits. This ability works as the 1st-level improve kit
class feature, except the equipment bonuses improve by an additional +1.

**Reconfigure Weapon**

At 4th level, an Engineer can reconfigure a melee or ranged weapon,
improving one aspect of it. Reconfiguring a weapon requires 1 hour of
work and a successful Repair check (DC 20); reconfiguring a mastercraft
weapon is slightly harder (DC 20 + the weapon’s mastercraft bonus
feature). An Engineer may take 10 or take 20 on this check.

The reconfiguration imposes a –1 penalty on attack rolls made with the
weapon but grants one of the following benefits indefinitely:

*Changed Rate of Fire:* The reconfiguration changes the weapon’s
rate of fire. A semiautomatic-only weapon switches to an automatic-only
weapon, or vice versa. This benefit applies only to a ranged weapon with
either a semiautomatic or automatic fire setting.

*Greater Ammo Capacity:* The reconfigured weapon can hold 50% more
ammunition than normal. This benefit applies only to weapons that take
ammunition.

*Greater Concealment:* The reconfiguration grants a +2 bonus on
Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal the reconfigured weapon.

*Greater Range Increment: *The reconfigured weapon’s range increment
increases by 10 feet. This benefit applies only to weapons with range
increments.

*Signature Shooter:* The weapon is reconfigured for a single
individual’s use only and is treated as a unique exotic weapon. Anyone
else who uses the weapon takes a –4 nonproficient penalty on attack
rolls.

Weapons can be reconfigured multiple times; each time a weapon is
reconfigured, it imparts a new benefit. Undoing an Engineer’s weapon
reconfiguration requires 1 hour and a successful Disable Device check
(DC 20 + the Engineer’s class level).

**Sabotage**

At 4th level and beyond, the Engineer can sabotage an electrical or
mechanical object so that it operates poorly. The Engineer must succeed
on a Disable Device check (DC 20) to accomplish the downgrade, and
sabotaging a mastercraft object is slightly harder (DC 20 + the
mastercraft object’s bonus feature). Noticing the Engineer’s handiwork
without first testing the sabotaged device requires a successful Search
check (DC = the Engineer’s Disable Device check result). Fixing the
sabotaged item requires a successful Repair.

*Sabotage Device:* As a full-round action, the Engineer can
reconfigure a device with electrical or mechanical components so that
anyone who uses it suffers a penalty equal to the Engineer’s class level
on skill checks made to use the device.

*Sabotage Weapon:* As a full-round action, the Engineer can sabotage
a weapon so that it misfires or breaks the next time it is used. A
sabotaged weapon cannot be used effectively until repaired. This use of
sabotage also applies to vehicle and starship weapons.

**Craft XP Reserve**

Starting at 5th level, an Engineer with the Mastercrafter feat can build
mastercraft electronic and mechanical devices without investing as much
of himself in the process.

At 5th level and every level thereafter, an Engineer gains a special
reserve of experience points equal to 100 × his Engineer class level.
These extra experience points are separate from experience gained
through level advancement and can only be used to make mastercraft
items; they do not count toward level gain.

An Engineer must spend the extra experience points he gains at each
level, for when the Engineer gains a level, he loses any unspent
experience points in his reserve.

**Improve Kit (+3)**

At 7th level, the Engineer can assemble mastercraft (+3) electrical and
mechanical tool kits. This ability works as the 4th-level improve kit
class feature, except the equipment bonuses improve by an additional +1.

**Quick Fix**

At 7th level, the Engineer can repair a mechanical or electrical device
in half the normal time; see the Repair skill description for normal
repair times. However, cutting the repair time increases the Repair
check DC by 5.

**Weapon Upgrade**

At 8th level, an Engineer can upgrade handheld or robot-installed
weapons, as well as weapon systems aboard vehicles, mecha, or starships.

</tbody>
</table>

The Engineer must spend 1 hour tinkering with the weapon, after which he
must succeed at a Craft (mechanical) check. The DC varies depending on
how the weapon is modified, as shown in Table: Weapon Upgrade. If the
skill check fails, the attempt to modify the weapon also fails, although
the Engineer may try again. (The engineer may take 20 on the skill
check, but the upgrade takes 20 hours to complete.) An upgraded weapon
has a 10% chance of breaking after each time it is used; it cannot be
used again until repaired, and repairing it requires 1 hour and a
successful Repair check (DC 40).

### Unflustered

A 10th-level Engineer can perform complicated tasks without provoking
attacks of opportunity from adjacent foes.

During any round in which the Engineer uses the Computer Use, Craft,
Demolitions, Disable Device, or Repair skill, he can first make a
Concentration check (DC 15) to use the desired skill without provoking
attacks of opportunity. Making the Concentration check doesn’t cost the
Engineer an action. He may take 10 on the Concentration check, but he
cannot take 20.

### Class Features

The following class features pertain to the Explorer advanced class.

**Explorer Lore**

An Explorer picks up stray and obscure facts during her adventures. She
may make a special Explorer lore check with a bonus equal to her
Explorer class level + her Intelligence modifier to see whether or not
she knows some relevant knowledge about notable people, legendary items,
or noteworthy places. If the Explorer has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge
(history), she gains a +2 bonus on this check. She may take 10 but
cannot take 20 on this check.

An Explorer lore check does not reveal the powers of a magic or psionic
item but may give some hint as to its general function; an Explorer may
not take 10 or take 20 on this check.

</tbody>
</table>

**Survivalist**

At 1st level, the Explorer gains the bonus feats Guide and Track.

**Resolve**

Beginning at 2nd level, an Explorer gains a morale bonus equal to
one-half her Explorer class level (rounded down) on saving throws to
resist fear effects and Intimidate checks.

**Skilled Searcher**

When actively searching for secret doors or traps, an Explorer of 2nd
level or higher gains a bonus on her Search checks equal to one-half her
Explorer class level (rounded down).

**Bonus Feats**

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Explorer gets a bonus feat. The bonus
feat must be selected from the following list, and the Explorer must
meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.

Action Boost, Advanced Two-Weapon Fighting, Aircraft Operation
(spacecraft), Archaic Weapons Proficiency, Attentive, Brawl, Dodge,
Educated, Endurance, Exotic Firearms Proficiency, Exotic Melee Weapon
Proficiency, Heroic Surge, Improved Feint, Improved Knockout Punch,
Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Jack of All Trades, Knockout Punch,
Mobility, Nimble, Renown, Spacer, Streetfighting, Studious, Track,
Two-Weapon Fighting, Vehicle Expert.

**Trap Sense**

At 4th level, an Explorer gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to
danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid
traps and a +1 dodge bonus to Defense against attacks made by traps.

These bonuses rise to +2 at 7th level and +3 at 10th level.

**Extra Step**

An Explorer of 5th level or higher can spend an action point to take an
extra 5-foot step during her turn, as a free action. This extra 5-foot
step does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

At 10th level, the Explorer can take the extra 5-foot step without
spending an action point.

**Explorer’s Evasion**

If an Explorer of 8th level or higher is exposed to any effect that
normally allows a character to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half
damage, the Explorer suffers no damage if she makes a successful saving
throw. If the Explorer already has evasion, she gains improved evasion
instead. Improved evasion works similar to evasion, except the Explorer
suffers only half damage on a failed saving throw.

### Class Features

The following class features pertain to the Field Officer advanced
class.

**Leadership**

By providing supervision and guidance, a Field Officer can improve an
ally’s chances of succeeding at a skill check. Instead of making a skill
check to aid another, the Field Officer makes a Diplomacy check (DC 10).
He cannot take 10 or take 20 on the check. Success grants a competence
bonus on the ally’s skill check equal to the Field Officer’s Charisma
bonus or Reputation bonus, whichever is greater. The ally must be within
sight and hearing distance of the Field Officer and must be able to
understand him.

A Field Officer cannot use this ability on himself.

**Uncanny Survival**

Beginning at 2nd level, a Field Officer can add one-half his class level
to his Defense for 1 round, once per day. (The bonus applies to the
Field Officer’s touch and flat-footed Defense, as well.) He must declare
he is doing this at the beginning of his turn, and the Defense bonus
lasts until his next round of actions.

**Bonus Feats**

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Field Officer gets a bonus feat. The
bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Field
Officer must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.

Advanced Firearms Proficiency, Armor Proficiency (light), Armor
Proficiency (medium), Armor Proficiency (heavy), Armor Proficiency
(powered), Combat Expertise, Dodge, Improved Initiative, Iron Will,
Mobility, Precise Shot, Quick Draw, Renown, Shot on the Run.

**Tactical Expertise**

Starting at 4th level, as a full-round action, a Field Officer can use
his tactical knowledge to coordinate allies. Allies to be affected must
be within sight and hearing distance of the Field Officer and must be
able to understand him.

The Field Officer must make a Knowledge (tactics) check with a DC equal
to 15 + the number of allies affected. He cannot take 10 or take 20 on
the check. If the check succeeds, all affected allies gain a competence
bonus on attack rolls or a dodge bonus to Defense equal to the Field
Officer’s Reputation bonus. The Field Officer chooses which of the two
benefits to impart and must impart the same benefit to all affected
allies. The benefits last for 1 round.

If the check fails, the Field Officer’s allies gain no benefit, but the
action is still spent.

A Field Officer cannot apply the benefits of this ability to himself.

**August Leadership**

The Field Officer gains this ability at 5th level. It works like the
leadership ability (see above), except the Field Officer adds his
Charisma bonus and his Reputation bonus to the ally’s skill check.

**Tactical Mastery**

At 7th level, the Field Officer requires less time to direct his allies.
This ability is similar to tactical expertise (see Tactical Expertise,
above) but requires an attack action instead of a full-round action.

**Commanding Presence**

At 8th level and beyond, a Field Officer can use an attack action and
his commanding presence to enable an ally or weaken a single foe’s
resolve.

Enabling an ally requires an attack action and a successful Diplomacy
check (DC 20). If the check succeeds, the Field Officer can negate any
one of the following harmful conditions affecting a single ally:
cowering, dazed, fatigued, nauseated, panicked, shaken, or stunned. The
ally to be affected must be within sight and hearing distance of the
Field Officer and must be able to understand him.

The Field Officer cannot use this ability on himself.

Weakening a foe’s resolve requires an attack action and a successful
Intimidate check (DC = target’s level check) . If the check succeeds,
the target is shaken for a number of rounds equal to 1d6 + one-half the
Field Officer’s class level + the Field Officer’s Charisma modifier. The
target must be within sight and hearing distance of the Field Officer
and must be able to understand him. A target that resists the Field
Officer’s attempt to weaken its resolve is immune to the Field Officer’s
use of this ability for 24 hours.

**Action Trust**

At 10th level, the Field Officer’s mere presence inspires, safeguards,
and motivates his allies.

As a free action, a Field Officer may spend one of his action points to
modify an ally’s attack roll, skill check, ability check, level check,
or saving throw result by +2d6 (applying a bonus of +2 to +12).

The ally to be affected must be within sight and hearing distance of the
Field Officer to gain the benefits of the Field Officer’s spent action
point. A Field Officer may use this ability once per round, and not on
himself (he gains the normal benefits for spending an action point on
himself).

Any character may transfer some or all of her action points to the Field
Officer as a free action. The Field Officer must consent to the
transfer, and these action points become the Field Officer’s to spend as
he sees fit.

### Class Features

Helix Warriors can carry more heavy gear than the typical soldier. A
Helix Warrior’s Strength is considered 4 points higher for the purpose

Helix Warriors are light sleepers and can make Listen checks even while
asleep, without penalty. (A sleeping character normally takes a –10
penalty on Listen checks.)

**Survivor**

saving throw, she may roll an additional 1d6 and take the best result,
discarding the lower roll(s).

**Darkvision**

Beginning at 2nd level, a Helix Warrior gains darkvision. She can see in
total darkness out to a range of 60 feet. Darkvision is black-andwhite

Wrench**

Space Monkeys use tools expertly and creatively. Starting at 2nd level,
a Space Monkey gains a competence bonus equal to one-half his Space
Monkey class level on skill checks made when using a tool kit. This
bonus stacks with the tool kit’s normal equipment bonus.

Furthermore, a Space Monkey gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls
against an opponent flanked by another Space Monkey; this bonus is in
addition to the usual +2 bonus for flanking.

**Know Location**

At 5th level, a Space Monkey gains a +2 competence bonus on Navigate and
Survival checks to avoid becoming lost. This bonus increases to +4 at
8th level.

**Monkey Shines**

Upon reaching 7th level, a Space Monkey has learned sneaky tactics. He
can use the Bluff technique of feinting in combat as a move action,
allowing him to feint and attack in the same round.

If the Space Monkey also has the Improved Feint feat, he gains a +4
bonus (instead of the feat’s usual +2 bonus) on Bluff checks made to
feint in combat.

**Space Suitable**

At 8th level, a Space Monkey becomes more comfortable in armor. He
treats any suit of armor as though its armor penalty and maximum
Dexterity bonus were 1 better.

### Class Features

The following class features pertain to the Swindler advanced class.

**Cheat Fate**

Fortune favors the Swindler. Once per day, he may reroll one roll that
he has just made before the success or failure of the result is
announced. The Swindler must take the result of the reroll, even if it’s
worse than the original roll.

**Thousand Faces**

A Swindler’s ability to manipulate probability makes him unpopular in
certain circles, increasing the need for a ready number of disguises. At
2nd level, the Swindler becomes a master of the quick disguise. He can
don a convincing disguise in one-tenth the normal time (1d4 minutes).

**Bonus Feats**

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Swindler gets a bonus feat. The bonus
feat must be selected from the following list, and the Swindler must
meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.

Action Boost, Blind-Fight, Confident, Deceptive, Educated, Elusive
Target, Low Profile, Nimble, Renown, Trustworthy.

**Fortune’s Favor**

Starting at 4th level, the Swindler learns to subtly manipulate the
fortunes of his adversaries, making him harder to strike in combat. He
can spend an action point to gain a +2 luck bonus to Defense against all
attacks for 1 round. The Swindler must use this ability on his turn, and
the bonus lasts until just before the Swindler’s next turn. A Swindler
uses this ability instead of Dodge on his turn.

The luck bonus to Defense increases to +4 at 7th level and +6 at 10th
level.

**Warp Probability**

At 5th level, the Swindler can affect another creature’s attack roll,
skill check, ability check, level check, or saving throw. As a free
action during another creature’s turn, the Swindler can spend an action
point to alter the target’s d20 roll result. The Swindler must be within
30 feet of the target, must be able to see the target, and must declare
that he’s spending the action point before the the result of the
target’s roll is revealed. The Swindler’s action-point die result counts
either as a bonus or penalty to the target’s roll, at the Swindler’s
discretion.

At 8th level, the range of this ability increases to 60 feet.

salvage a wrecked vehicle, mecha, starship, robot, or cybernetic
attachment in half the usual time (see the Salvage feat description for

### Class Features

The following class features pertain to the Xenophile advanced class.

**Xenolore**

A Xenophile can make a Knowledge check to identify certain
characteristics of a xenomorph, including any special attacks, special
qualities, or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of the Knowledge check
equals 10 + the xenomorph’s Hit Dice. A successful check allows the
Xenophile to unlock a single fact about the xenomorph. For every 5
points by which her check result exceeds the DC, the Xenophile learns
another piece of useful information.

The type of Knowledge check depends on the xenomorph’s creature type, as
shown below:

*Knowledge (arcane lore):* Fey, magical beasts.

*Knowledge (earth and life sciences):* Aberrations, animals,
dragons, elementals, giants, humanoids, monstrous humanoids, oozes,
plants, vermin.

*Knowledge (technology):* Constructs.

*Knowledge (theology and philosophy):* Outsiders, undead.

**Xenotype**

A Xenophile studies the behaviors and weaknesses of particular
xenomorphs and knows how to exploit them.

At 1st level, a Xenophile may select a type of creature (also called a
“xenotype”) from among those given on Table: Xenotypes. She must meet
the special prerequisite to choose a xenotype, as specified in the
table. Due to her extensive study of the chosen type of foe and training
in the proper techniques for combating or negotiating with such
creatures, the Xenophile gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Intimidate, Listen,
Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against
members of the chosen xenotype. Likewise, she gets a +2 bonus on weapon
damage rolls against such creatures.

At 4th, 7th, and 10th level, the Xenophile may select an additional
xenotype from those given on the table. In addition, at each such
interval, the bonus against any one xenotype (including the one just
selected, if desired) increases by 2. A Xenophile who chooses humanoids
as a xenotype must also specify a particular species.

**Xenoresistance**

At 2nd level, a Xenophile gains a +1 bonus on saving throws to resist
the extraordinary, spell-like, or supernatural attacks of species other
than her own. This bonus increases to +2 at 5th level and +3 at 8th
level.

**Bonus Feats**

At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Xenophile gets a bonus feat. The bonus
feat must be selected from the following list, and the Xenophile must
meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.

Alien Weapons Proficiency, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Educated, Medical
Expert, Mobility, Studious, Surgery, Weapon Focus, Xenomedic.

**Xenodefense**

At 5th level, during her action, the Xenophile can designate an opponent
and receive a +1 insight bonus to Defense against any subsequent attacks
from that opponent. The opponent must belong to one of the Xenophile’s
chosen xenotypes (see Xenotype, above).

The Xenophile can select a new opponent on any action. At 10th level,
the insight bonus to Defense increases to +2.
