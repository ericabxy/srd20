Half-giant
----------

Often called simply "giants" due to their stature, half-giants typically stand from 7 feet to nearly 8 feet tall and weigh from 250 to 400 pounds, with men noticeably taller and heavier than women. They are known throughout the system as philosophers, leaders, diplomats, and artists. Legend has it that many humanoid species are actually descended from giant ancestors thousands of years ago.

Half-giants are traditionally craftsmen, specializing in anything from tools to buildings. Their culture is home to hundreds of traditional folk songs passed down through generations, making some of them excellent bards.

### Half-giant Traits

* +2 Wisdom, +2 Strength, −2 Dexterity.
* Half-giant base land speed is 30 feet.
* __Giant:__ As humanoids with the giant subtype, half-giants are not subject to spells or effects that affect humanoids only, such as _charm person_ or _dominate person_.
* __Medium:__ As Medium creatures, half-giants have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
* __Powerful Build:__ The physical stature of half-giants lets them function in many ways as if they were one size category larger.
* +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks.
* +2 racial bonus on Craft (any) checks.

### Powerful Build

Whenever a half-giant is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the half-giant is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him.

A half-giant is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature’s special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A half-giant can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject’s size category.

Experimental
------------

__Channeling:__ Half-giant spellcasters gain bonus spells as if the governing ability score were 2 points higher. This benefit does not grant them the ability to cast spells unless they gain that ability through levels in a spellcaster class.

_Stomp (Sp):_ Once per day, a half-giant can use a standard action to *stomp* with his foot which precipitates a psychokinetic shock wave that travels along the ground, toppling creatures and loose objects. The shock wave affects only creatures standing on the ground within a 20ft cone emanating from the half-giant. Creatures that fail a Reflex save (DC 10 + the half-giant's Cha modifier) are thrown to the ground, become prone, and take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage.
