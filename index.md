## Welcome to the Srd20 Project!

This is a project to document Open Game Content related to the _System Reference Document_ version 3.5 released by _Wizards of the Coast_ in 2003. So far we serve parts of the SRD and the Modern SRD as well as some Open Game Content from D&D supplements and original content based on the system. Click on the posts for links to the reference documents, new special abilities, and new character backgrounds.
