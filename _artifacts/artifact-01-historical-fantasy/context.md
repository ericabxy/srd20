__The Province of Noricum, A.D. 125__ during the reign of Emperor Hadrian.

A small provincial settlement on the Roman frontier just south of the Danube, built along a road connecting the interior to the border garrisons. Roman authority in the region is distant and strained, competing with local needs and customs.

Rome depends on cooperation from the local population and forcing compliance with Roman law can have consequences. Maintaining trust and reputation are the preferred mode of enforcement.

If conflict arises, Roman authority must be imposed eventually. Locals are reluctant, especially if compliance is a hardship. Compromise is never guaranteed.
