# The Weight of Authority

[Overview](index) &bull; [Context](context) &bull; [Scenario](scenario) &bull; [Characters](characters) &bull; __Design Notes__

## Design Notes

This artifact focuses on a compulsory transport requisition. Other common imperial burdens, such as quartering, are deliberately excluded to keep the pressure logistical rather than domestic.

### Themes

* Power is personal, not abstract
* Institutions are only as strong as their agents
* Knowledge, labor, and violence are all mechanically legible
* Cultural difference is expected, not exceptional
* Obligation creates pressure long before combat begins

### Characters

The characters for this scenario are written as archetypal roles. Names, cultures, and circumstances are intentionally specific to this scenario, but the underlying authority model is designed to be portable.

* Julius, human cleric - Official, lawful, and recognized authority.
* Tignos, dwarven fighter - Authority through practical competence and force.
* Macha, elven wizard - Epistemic authority derived from custom, belief, and historical precedent.
* Laufey, halfling rogue - Authority derived from mobility and living on the margins of society.
