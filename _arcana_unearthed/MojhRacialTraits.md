### Mojh Racial Traits

* Mojh are very intelligent—their intellect is, in fact, magically enhanced during their transformation, giving them a +2 racial bonus to Intelligence. However, they are thinner and less sturdy than the humans they once were, imposing a –2 racial penalty to Constitution.
* __Medium:__ As Medium creatures, mojh have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
* Mojh base speed is 30 feet.
* Because they use their tails to help them keep their balance, mojh enjoy a +2 racial bonus to Balance checks.
* Mojh have a natural affinity for runes, symbols, and so on, granting them a +2 to Knowledge (runes) and Forgery checks.
* __Darkvision:__ Mojh can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but otherwise resembles normal sight. Mojh can function just fine with no light at all.
* __Natural Armor:__ Their scaly hides provide mojh with a +1 natural armor bonus to Armor Class.
* __Automatic Languages:__ Common and Draconic.
* __Bonus Languages:__ Any.
* __Racial Levels:__ Unlike humans, mojh can take a few levels in “mojh” as a class to develop their racial qualities more fully.
