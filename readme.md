information repository for a grand unified theory of the SRD and related systems

This is a project to generically describe the set of available abilities, feats, and skills in the SRD and beyond.

For example, Sneak Attack and its extra damage cousins, Uncanny Dodge, Evasion, and Fast Movement are used multiple times across the 11 core classes and the myriad of additional classes and prestige classes.
