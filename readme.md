Srd 20
======

information repository for a grand unified theory of the SRD and related systems

This is a project to generically describe the set of available abilities, feats, and skills in the SRD and beyond.

For example, Sneak Attack and its extra damage cousins, Uncanny Dodge, Evasion, and Fast Movement are used multiple times across the 11 core classes and the myriad of additional classes and prestige classes.

Style Guide
-----------

Not Capitalized: Class names (like fighter and rogue); feat names (like power attack and two-weapon fighting); base attack bonus.

Capitalized: Saving throw names and their abbreviations (like Fort, Ref, and Will); skill names (like Hide and Move Silently).

Italicized: the names of spells (like _daze_ and _hold portal_).

The em dash can be represented in Markdown with the Unicode character "—" or three dashes "---".

The minus sign can be represented in Markdown with the Unicode character "−" or two dashes "--".
