### Xeph Traits

Xeph characters possess the following background traits.

* +2 Dexterity, −2 Strength.
* __Medium:__ As Medium creatures, xeph have no special bonuses or penalties due  to their size.
* Xeph base land speed is 30 feet.
* __Darkvision:__ Xeph can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and xeph can function just fine with no light at all.
* +1 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects. Xeph have an innate resistance to magic.
* __Channeling:__ Xeph spellcasters gain bonus spells as if the governing ability score were 1 point higher. This benefit does not grant them the ability to cast spells unless they gain that ability through levels in a spellcaster class.
* __Burst (Su):__ Three times per day, a xeph can increase his or her speed by 10 feet, plus 10 feet per four character levels beyond 1st,  to a maximum increase of 30 feet at 9th character level and higher. These bursts of speed are considered a competence bonus to the xeph's base speed. A burst of speed lasts 3 rounds.
* __Favored Class:__ Monk.
