Half-giant
----------

Half-giants typically stand from 7 feet to nearly 8 feet tall and weigh from 250 to 400 pounds, with men noticeably taller and heavier than women.

### Half-giant Traits

* +2 Wisdom, +2 Strength, −2 Dexterity.
* __Giant:__ As humanoids with the giant subtype, half-giants are not subject to spells or effects that affect humanoids only, such as _charm person_ or _dominate person_.
* __Medium:__ As Medium creatures, half-giants have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
* Half-giant base land speed is 30 feet.
* __Powerful Build:__ The physical stature of half-giants lets them function in many ways as if they were one size category larger.
* +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks.
* +2 racial bonus on Craft (any) checks.
* __Favored Class:__ Bard.

### Powerful Build

Whenever a half-giant is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the half-giant is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him.

A half-giant is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature’s special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A half-giant can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject’s size category.
