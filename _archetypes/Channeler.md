title: Channeler
---

__Hit Die:__ d8.

__Good Saving Throws:__ Will (and possibly Fort).

__Base Attack Bonus:__ Average (or poor with improved bonuses).

__Channel Energy:__ A channeler has the power to channel positive or negative energy, chosen upon gaining their first level in this class. A channeled energy attempt can be used to cause a variety of effects. A channeler may attempt to channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier.

_Turn Creature (Su):_ Channel energy has the power to affect undead creatures, summoned creatures, extraplanar creatures, constructs animated by magic, and creatures with an alignment subtype. Creatures with the native subtype are unaffected unless otherwise specified.

- Any creature with the undead type.
- Any creature summoned by a spell or spell-like ability such as _summon nature's ally_, _summon monster_, or _summon_.
- Any creature with the construct type if animated by magic.
- Any creature with an alignment subtype (good, evil, lawful, chaotic).

See [Turn or Rebuke Undead](/CombatII#turn-or-rebuke-undead) for how to make a turning attempt against such creatures, treating channeler level as cleric level.

All affected creatures are turned by positive energy or rebuked by negative energy. Only undead creatures can be destroyed or commanded. Negative energy can dispel turning or bolster creatures against turning attempts.

A channeler may attempt to turn creatures a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. A channeler with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) gets a +2 bonus on turning checks against undead.

__Spontaneous Casting:__ A positive-energy channeler can "lose" any prepared spell that is not a domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with "cure" in its name).

A negative-energy channeler can’t convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict spells (an inflict spell is one with “inflict” in its name).
