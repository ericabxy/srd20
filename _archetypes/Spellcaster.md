__Spells:__ A spellcaster casts arcane spells which are drawn from the universal spell list. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time, the way a wizard or a cleric must.

To learn or cast a spell, the spellcaster must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a spellcaster’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the spellcaster’s Intelligence modifier.

A spellcaster can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Spellcaster. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score.

Unlike a bard or sorcerer, a wizard may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting a good night’s sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the wizard decides which spells to prepare.
