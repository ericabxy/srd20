Some special abilities seem to correlate with the ability to cast spells.

### Turn Undead

The [cleric](/ClassesI#cleric) learns turn undead at 1st level. The [paladin](/ClassesI#paladin) learns the same ability at the same time as she gains her first spellcasting slot (4th level).

### Animal Companion

Both the [druid](/ClassesI#druid) and the [ranger](/ClassesII#ranger) gain an animal companion. The ranger gains it at the same time as his first spellcasting slot (4th level).
