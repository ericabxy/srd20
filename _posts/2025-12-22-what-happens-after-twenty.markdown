Epic level rules (as recorded in the Epic category of the SRD) define a looser progression pattern after 20th level for all classes compared to the first twenty levels. Certain progression tracks stop completely, while others continue a pattern established before becoming epic. Notably most classes gain a bonus feat at some rate, providing access to additional class-specific special abilities but as a choice rather than a rigid schedule.

### What Stays the Same for Everyone?

Characters of any class continue gaining a feat every third level and increasing one ability score every fourth level.
