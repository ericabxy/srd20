Bardic Knowledge
----------------

__Prerequisties:__ [Bard spells](/BardSpells).

You may make a special bardic knowledge check with a bonus equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier to see whether you know some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. (If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), you gain a +2 bonus on this check.)

A successful bardic knowledge check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its general function. You may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is essentially random.
