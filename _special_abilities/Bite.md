Bite [General]
--------------

Although most civilized creatures have lost the skill to use their sharp teeth in combat, you can use yours as terrible weapons.

__Prerequisite:__ A race with powerful jaws and sharp teeth, base attack bonus +1.

__Benefit:__ The character is proficient with using bite attacks in combat and, unless gagged or muzzled, is always considered armed (and the bite is considered a light weapon). The character inflicts damage based on her size, as follows:

| Size               | Damage
| ----               | ------
| Diminutive or Fine | 1d2 + Strength bonus
| Tiny               | 1d3 + Strength bonus
| Small              | 1d4 + Strength bonus
| Medium             | 1d6 + Strength bonus
| Large              | 2d4 + Strength bonus
| Huge               | 2d6 + Strength bonus
| Gargantuan         | 2d8 + Strength bonus
| Colossal           | 2d10 + Strength bonus

When a character takes a feat requiring her to specify a weapon (such as the Weapon Focus feat), she can choose “bite.”

If a character also uses a weapon (or unarmed attack) in the same round, the bite is considered an “off-hand” attack with which the character has “Ambidexterity” and “Two Weapon Fighting” automatically---that is to say, both the bite attack and the other attack suffer a –2 penalty. A character fighting with a weapon in each hand (or a double weapon) can make a bite attack, but all attacks suffer a –4 penalty in addition to normal two-weapon fighting penalties the character might suffer.

__Normal:__ Characters whose racial description does not include this feat cannot use bite attacks effectively in combat. Monsters with bite attacks do not need this feat.
