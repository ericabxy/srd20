Special Mount
-------------

__Prerequisites:__ Base attack bonus +5, ability to cast divine spells.

You gain the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve you on a holy crusade. This mount is usually a heavy warhorse (for a Medium character) or a warpony (for a Small character).

Once per day, as a full-round action, you may magically call your mount from the celestial realms in which it resides. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third your level. The mount immediately appears adjacent to you and remains for 2 hours per level; it may be dismissed at any time as a free action. The mount is the same creature each time it is summoned, though you may release a particular mount from service.

Each time the mount is called, it appears in full health, regardless of any damage it may have taken previously. The mount also appears wearing or carrying any gear it had when it was last dismissed. Calling a mount is a conjuration (calling) effect.

Should the mount die, it immediately disappears, leaving behind any equipment it was carrying. You may not summon another mount for thirty days or until you gain a character level, whichever comes first, even if the mount is somehow returned from the dead. During this thirty-day period, you take a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.
